The development of more powerful and tunable electron donors has broad impacts on wide areas of chemistry and society, from additions to the toolbox of synthetic organic chemistry and natural products chemistry to insights into the catalytic production of clean and sustainable fuels, which is one of the grand challenges facing science today. The project combines the complementary expertise of Professor Njardarson (organic synthesis), Professor Lichtenberger (inorganic chemistry, spectroscopy, thermodynamics and mechanisms) and Professor Evans (electrochemistry), and benefits from collaborations with other synthetic and theoretical chemists. The project also has broad community participation. Teachers at schools with large Native American student populations participate in the research.<br/><br/>The research uses gas phase photoelectron spectroscopy to study dimetal complexes with bicyclic guanidinate ligands that are the strongest electron donors yet known. This project investigates the structure, dynamics and mechanisms of this class of electron donors using a range of synthetic, spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational techniques.

Peptide and protein assemblies can contribute to many devastating diseases such as Alzheimer's disease because of amyloid formation. This is an active area of research both for its fundamental importance and its potential impacts on health. Through the studies on model amino acids and peptides, factors that control larger peptide and protein assembly can be learned, which can help the development of new therapeutic agents. The project is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels, including those underrepresented in science. Outreach activities to high school students in the Ventura and Santa Barbara areas are also part of the funded project. A free website that allows the accurate and rapid calculation of cross sections of model structures is also supported by this grant. <br/><br/>Specifically, this grant is focused on the assembly of amino acids and small peptides. In these studies, Ion Mobility based Mass Spectrometry (IMS-MS) is used as the main tool. In collaboration with the group of Gert von Helden at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin, IMS-MS is coupled with the Fritz Haber free electron laser to do spectroscopy on size and shape selected oligomers of both amino acids and small peptides. The overarching goal is to understand the molecular mechanism of the amyloid cascade that is often observed for peptides and proteins in systems related to many devastating diseases. The amyloid hypothesis states that peptides natively fold and isotropically assemble until at a system dependent size they rearrange to beta sheet and rapidly add monomers to form fibrils. The group, in past NSF support periods, observed this process for specific peptide systems. The current project seeks to understand these observations and to develop an algorithm that can accurately predict the predilection of a peptide or protein to form amyloid knowing only the primary structure."},{"AwardNumber":"1604927","Title":"Collaborative Research: Understanding ion solvation effects in nonaqueous oxygen electroreduction reactions","NSFOrganization":"CBET","Program(s)":"ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABILITY","StartDate":"09/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"06/02/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Bryan McCloskey","State":"CA","Organization":"University of California-Berkeley","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Geoffrey Prentice","EndDate":"08/31/2019","AwardedAmountToDate":"$202,352.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"bmcclosk@berkeley.edu","OrganizationStreet":"Sponsored Projects Office","OrganizationCity":"BERKELEY","OrganizationState":"CA","OrganizationZip":"947045940","OrganizationPhone":"5106428109","NSFDirectorate":"ENG","ProgramElementCode(s)":"7644","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Title: Collaborative Research: Understanding Ion Solvation Effects in Nonaqueous Oxygen Electroreduction Reactions<br/>Bryan D.

Molecular chemistry brings advantages such as solubility and crystallinity to this goal. It also provides methods for optimizing molecules for particular studies, such as characterizing the quantum physics properties important to these potential applications. The project's scope is broad spanning chemistry and physics. The project also provides new knowledge at the nanoscale that is not often available from traditional magnetic nanoparticles.

These nebulous and fragile effects are detected and studied with techniques such as high-frequency electron paramagnetic (HFEPR) spectroscopy in the solid state. Extension of the HFEPR studies to frozen solutions is crucial to determine if structures and quantum effects remain unchanged on dissolution, providing a second phase for their study.

Lattice models, constructed to study natural phase transitions, are probability distributions on subsets of graphs depending on continuous parameters. This research project will study the phase transition of several important lattice models, including (1) the constrained percolation model, which randomly assigns ""0"" or ""1"" to each vertex of a graph, satisfying constraints that represent aspects of molecular structure; and (2) the self-avoiding walk, which is a path on a graph visiting each vertex at most once, introduced as a model for long-chain polymers. The work will broaden and deepen the mathematical foundations of the subject, with potential important applications in theoretical physics and chemistry.<br/><br/>The investigator aims to develop new theory concerning the phase transition of certain lattice models. Imposing constraints in the percolation model usually makes the model lose stochastic monotonicity, which, in the unconstrained case, is critical to study the phase transition described by the behavior of infinite clusters. One goal of the project is to develop new combinatorial and probabilistic techniques to study the behavior of infinite clusters without using stochastic monotonicity. Enumerating self-avoiding walks is typically difficult due to the non-Markovian structure. The connective constant and exponent of self-avoiding walks are fundamental properties of the underlying graph, yet can be identified for very few graphs. Another goal of this project is to obtain new information about connective constants and exponents for large classes of graphs, which may be achieved by analyzing harmonic functions on graphs. An analog to the central limit theorem in two dimensions is the limit shape behavior of height functions of certain lattice models at criticality, i.e. when the phase transition occurs. The investigator also plans to study the limit shape, using techniques from complex analysis and algebraic geometry."},{"AwardNumber":"1639164","Title":"EAGER: Properties and Manufacturing of Transformative Aluminum Nanocomposite Electrical Conductors","NSFOrganization":"CMMI","Program(s)":"Manufacturing Machines & Equip","StartDate":"08/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"04/13/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Xiaochun Li","State":"CA","Organization":"University of California-Los Angeles","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Zhijian Pei","EndDate":"07/31/2018","AwardedAmountToDate":"$299,123.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"xcli@seas.ucla.edu","OrganizationStreet":"11000 Kinross Avenue, Suite 211","OrganizationCity":"LOS ANGELES","OrganizationState":"CA","OrganizationZip":"900952000","OrganizationPhone":"3107940102","NSFDirectorate":"ENG","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1468","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"082E, 083E, 7916","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Electricity transmission and distribution losses average about 6 percent of the electricity that is transmitted and distributed annually in the United States.

The recent explosion of ""big data"" has raised several critical challenges in detecting cross-sample variation, which render existing methods inadequate and entail an urgent need for new methodologies. The most notable and prevalent challenges include complex distributional structures, the highly local nature of variation, various extraneous sources of variation, data sparsity, and massive computational demand. The overarching aim of this research project is to develop a general framework including theory, methods, algorithms, and software for effectively identifying variation in modern big data sets to address these challenges. <br/><br/>Specific inference problems to be addressed in this research project include: (i) identifying differences, especially highly local variations, across multiple data sets; (ii) separating intrinsic (i.e., scientifically interesting) cross-sample variation from extraneous variation; (iii) decomposing cross-sample variation into contributions from multiple sources; and (iv) identifying cross-sample variation and variance components in general random objects, including a variety of processes and functional observations. The use of multi-scale inference and Bayesian nonparametric modeling has led to development of a general probabilistic model-based framework for detecting cross-sample variation that integrates two powerful inference tactics -- multi-resolution scanning and graphical modeling. Multi-resolution scanning is the strategy of scanning through the sample space using windows of various sizes, carrying out testing or estimation for the structure of interest -- the cross-sample variation -- on each window. A class of graphical models is then designed to incorporate various dependency structures across scanning windows and data samples, thereby allowing borrowing strength among windows and related samples to achieve high statistical efficiency in identifying cross-sample variation.

This necessitates many-core chips to be designed with the ability to power down on-chip resources to effectively provide scalable performance while keeping power and energy consumption proportional to computing load. This necessity leads to considerable portions of many-core chips having to go dark, thus ushering in the era of dark silicon. To facilitate dark silicon computing, not only computational resources (i.e., processor cores) but also communication resources (i.e., networks on chips, or NoCs) used to connect the computational resources must be developed that can be powered up or down proportionally with performance scalability in response to prevailing load.<br/><br/>This research investigates new opportunities, significant challenges, and innovative solutions for harnessing dark silicon in NoC architectures that meet performance, power and energy requirements in the dark silicon era. The objective is to enable non-essential NoC routers to be powered down when needed as well as to enable a corresponding maximum number of routers and router components to be powered down for a given reduction in the number of powered-up processor cores in order to provide energy-proportional, low-power, on-chip communication. Among some of the specific lines of research that are explored are alternative topologies and coordinated routing algorithms to enable more efficient power-gating of NoC routers, holistic approaches for exploiting coordination between the NoC and other on-chip system components as well as factoring in key application characteristics, and novel packet-oriented dynamic power control schemes that explore energy-saving opportunities beyond the conventionally targeted low-load traffic region.

Although reducing environmental impact is considered among the main advantages, very limited efforts have been made to rigorously evaluate the environmental performance of AM processes using the well-accepted life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology; also, even less studies are oriented toward process improvement. The overarching goal of this research is to advance understanding on how product design affects energy/material consumption and air emissions of representative AM processes. If successful, this research will bridge geometry and life cycle inventory (LCI), which provides much needed data foundation for LCA of AM processes and furthermore, enables the exploration of opportunities to re-design AM process and equipment for smaller environmental impacts. The research will be undertaken by a team consisting of experts in life cycle assessment, additive manufacturing, manufacturing process modeling, and pollution prevention at the Purdue University and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). <br/><br/>Four research tasks will be jointly pursued: (1) Material flow modeling and feedstock chemical composition analysis, (2) Energy consumption modeling, (3) Air emission characterization and quantification, and (4) AM process and equipment redesign for improved environmental performance. The research findings will be verified in both laboratory and industrial settings. The research is an effort to systematically evaluate the environmental impacts of the emerging AM processes using LCA methodology, with particular focus on unit process level LCI. The project will advance understanding of the material/energy flow and air emissions associated with four representative AM processes. The proposed LCI model is capable of predicting inventory flows of environmental significance while requiring only minimal experimental efforts. The research is an effort to bridge geometry and LCI of AM processes, which can guide the design and development of AM equipment and processes for enhanced environmental sustainability. Deeper understanding on energy consumption, feedstock material composition, and occupation hazard risk due to particulate matters and volatile organic compounds can provide guidelines for designers, manufacturers, and government agencies to safeguard workforce and reduce environmental footprints of AM processes. This will in turn accelerate the larger scale technology adoption of AM, and offer a competitive edge regarding sustainability to the U.S. manufacturing sector in the global market. Research results will be broadly disseminated through journal papers, conference presentations, online demonstrations, and industrial collaboration. The educational activities will strengthen the awareness of advanced life cycle analysis on additive manufacturing in engineering and environmental fields.

A doughnut and the spatial universe are both examples of three-manifolds. These objects arise naturally in many contexts in physical and other natural sciences and model many interesting phenomena. A geometric way of studying them is to cut a complicated three-manifold into simpler three-dimensional pieces along two-dimensional surfaces. For example, a so-called Heegaard splitting is such a decomposition. One can also use a technique known as surgery on a three-manifold that replaces a geometric piece with a different one. In this project, the PI plans to study various questions on three-manifolds using Heegaard splitting and surgery. The research targets several central questions in low-dimensional topology and knot theory, which has potential impact on other areas of scientific investigations, such as the topological structures of DNA.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI plans to study topology of three-manifolds. The first part of the research is to study a long-standing conjecture concerning Heegaard genus and degree-one map. The conjecture can be translated into a study of how Heegaard genus changes under a special type of surgeries and the PI plans to study such surgeries. The PI also plans to study several related questions on Heegaard genus of certain amalgamated three-manifolds. The second part of the project is to explore a new approach to proving the Berge Conjecture. This approach is inspired by the PI's observation that if there is a certain intersection pattern, then one can perform a stabilization and then an unstabilization, changing a Heegaard splitting of a knot exterior (in a lens space) into a meridionally primitive splitting. The PI plans to develop new tools and use techniques from his previous work to achieve these goals."},{"AwardNumber":"1617713","Title":"AF: Small: Randomness in Computation - Old Problems and New Directions","NSFOrganization":"CCF","Program(s)":"ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS","StartDate":"07/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"05/25/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Xin Li","State":"MD","Organization":"Johns Hopkins University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Rahul Shah","EndDate":"06/30/2019","AwardedAmountToDate":"$374,815.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"lixints@cs.jhu.edu","OrganizationStreet":"3400 N CHARLES ST","OrganizationCity":"Baltimore","OrganizationState":"MD","OrganizationZip":"212182608","OrganizationPhone":"4105168668","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"7796","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"7923, 7927","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"A major goal of computer science is to study how to compute more efficiently using limited resources. The understanding of this question has had profound influence on our daily life, in a variety of areas ranging from e-commerce, cloud computing, to travel planning and weather forecast. In this project the PI seeks to understand how to efficiently use the valuable resource of randomness (such as coin flips) in computation.<br/><br/>Randomness is extremely useful in computation and widely used in practice. Simulation of complex models such as those used for weather forecast and economy prediction relies on the use of random processes, and modern computer security will be lost completely without randomness. In this context, the project studies the fundamental questions of the power and limitations of randomness in computation. From a theoretical aspect, it can lead to breakthroughs towards solving long standing open questions in computer science, such as whether randomness is really necessary for algorithms. From a practical aspect, it can lead to improvements in several areas important to society, such as designing streaming and scalable computation protocols for massive datasets, enhancing computer security in an adversarial environment, and tolerating errors in communication protocols. Based on the research activities, the educational component in this project plans to train several Ph.D. students, publish online surveys for free access, integrate research outcomes into courses the PI is or will be teaching, and provide research opportunities for minority students through a joint effort with Johns Hopkins University.<br/><br/>The questions that will be addressed in this project include how to generate high quality randomness for computation, how to use randomness in the presence of information leakage or tampering by an adversary, and how to use randomness to detect and correct errors introduced in communications. Two fundamental objects and tools for studying these questions are pseudorandom generators and randomness extractors. A pseudorandom generator is an algorithm that stretches a small number of random bits into a large number of bits that appear to be perfectly random to a certain class of functions. A randomness extractor is an algorithm that converts low quality random sources into very high quality random bits. The project will explore new ways of constructing these objects, as well as the connections between these objects and other areas in computer science, such as cryptography, error correcting codes, and computational complexity. Through this the PI seeks to establish new connections between different areas, and thus leading to possible new breakthroughs."},{"AwardNumber":"1564348","Title":"TWC: Medium: Collaborative: Online Social Network Fraud and Attack Research and Identification","NSFOrganization":"CNS","Program(s)":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace","StartDate":"07/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"03/28/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Jun Li","State":"OR","Organization":"University of Oregon Eugene","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Christopher Clifton","EndDate":"06/30/2020","AwardedAmountToDate":"$507,052.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"lijun@cs.uoregon.edu","OrganizationStreet":"5219 UNIVERSITY OF OREGON","OrganizationCity":"Eugene","OrganizationState":"OR","OrganizationZip":"974035219","OrganizationPhone":"5413465131","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"8060","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"7434, 7924","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Online social networks (OSNs) face various forms of fraud and attacks, such as spam, denial of service, Sybil attacks, and viral marketing. In order to build trustworthy and secure OSNs, it has become critical to develop techniques to analyze and detect OSN fraud and attacks. Existing OSN security approaches usually target a specific type of OSN fraud or attack and often fall short of detecting more complex attacks such as collusive attacks that involve many fraudulent OSN accounts, or dynamic attacks that encompass multiple attack phases over time. This research, dubbed oSAFARI (Online SociAl network Fraud and Attack Research and Identification), models, analyzes and characterizes OSN frauds and attacks; designs, develops, and evaluates a new approach to detecting static OSN frauds and attacks; and further enhances the approach to handle dynamic attacks with multiple phases. The research team plans to develop a new course focused on OSN attacks and defenses, which has the potential to be offered across many institutions. To increase public security awareness, the team also plans to develop tutorial courses on typical OSN attacks and their defense and offer them at popular public events and in freshman classes. The research team will broadly disseminate their results, tools, software, and documents to the research community, IT industries, and to OSN companies.<br/><br/>This project embraces a systematic, comprehensive study of OSN frauds and attacks. It models OSN threats by viewing an OSN as a graph embedded with attacker nodes and edges, identifies and analyzes specific forms of frauds and attacks, and evaluates state-of-the-art attack analysis and defense approaches. It develops a spectral-analysis-based framework for OSN fraud and attack detection. The framework transforms topological information of an OSN graph into patterns formed by spectral coordinates in the spectral space, and introduces the use of the spectral graph perturbation theory to more easily model and capture changes of spectral coordinates for attacker, victim, and regular nodes. Further, this research develops spectral-analysis-based detection approaches for complex networks where nodes can carry attributes and edges can be negative, weighted, or asymmetric. Through a novel combination of the network dynamics and the vector autoregressive model, it develops an automatic spectral-analysis-based approach to detecting dynamic attacks while avoiding the high cost and low accuracy of traditional approaches. It also transforms attack characteristics from high-dimensional spectral spaces into distinctive visual patterns, and develops interactive mechanisms for analysts to incorporate domain knowledge and flexibly handle attacks. The research team will build a simulation framework to evaluate the detection approaches against different types of OSN attacks, where one can plug in different OSN datasets to evaluate and compare different detection approaches. Moreover, the research team will build a prototype oSAFARI on top of an OSN, and evaluate how oSAFARI can withstand various attacks in a real setting."},{"AwardNumber":"1611680","Title":"Topology of Symplectic 4-Manifolds","NSFOrganization":"DMS","Program(s)":"TOPOLOGY","StartDate":"07/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"05/23/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Tian-Jun Li","State":"MN","Organization":"University of Minnesota-Twin Cities","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Swatee Naik","EndDate":"06/30/2019","AwardedAmountToDate":"$267,029.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"TJLI@MATH.UMN.EDU","OrganizationStreet":"200 OAK ST SE","OrganizationCity":"Minneapolis","OrganizationState":"MN","OrganizationZip":"554552070","OrganizationPhone":"6126245599","NSFDirectorate":"MPS","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1267","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"This research project investigates the properties of symplectic manifolds.

This necessitates many-core chips to be designed with the ability to power down on-chip resources to effectively provide scalable performance while keeping power and energy consumption proportional to computing load. This necessity leads to considerable portions of many-core chips having to go dark, thus ushering in the era of dark silicon. To facilitate dark silicon computing, not only computational resources (i.e., processor cores) but also communication resources (i.e., networks on chips, or NoCs) used to connect the computational resources must be developed that can be powered up or down proportionally with performance scalability in response to prevailing load.<br/><br/>This research investigates new opportunities, significant challenges, and innovative solutions for harnessing dark silicon in NoC architectures that meet performance, power and energy requirements in the dark silicon era. The objective is to enable non-essential NoC routers to be powered down when needed as well as to enable a corresponding maximum number of routers and router components to be powered down for a given reduction in the number of powered-up processor cores in order to provide energy-proportional, low-power, on-chip communication.

Ions are charged atomic or molecular species that can dissolve in solvents like water or organic liquids. Ions are important in a very broad range of natural and technological systems. Table salt is the most common everyday example, but ions of many kinds figure prominently in electrochemistry, colloids, surface chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, soaps and detergents, biological membrane ion channels, geology, and energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors). Not all ions are the same; in fact, the ion identity (through its size, shape, and chemistry) can dramatically affect the properties of a given system. The focus of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of what causes such large differences between ionic species. This research aids in developing more accurate models for how the ions interact with solvents such as water or organic liquids (such as ethylene carbonate, the solvent in the lithium (Li)-ion batteries used in every electronic device). Towards this end, Beck and his coworkers employ accurate models that come from the fundamental theory of nature, quantum mechanics. Their goal is to learn about basic aspects of ion solvation and then produce reliable models that can help understand problems like atmospheric chemistry and the development of longer-lasting batteries. The educational component of this project centers on continued development of a course on sustainable energy. Professor Beck is currently the chair of the State Users Group at the Ohio Supercomputer Center, with over 1000 active computational science users. <br/><br/><br/>This project addresses fundamental aspects of ion solvation in water and organic solvents. Ion solvation figures prominently in surface chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, soaps and detergents, biological membrane ion channels, geology, and energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors). Beck and his coworkers aim to establish a fundamental energy scale for single-ion solvation. This allows for a firmer groundwork for studying specific ion effects. The research also leads to the development of better classical models that can be applied to much larger systems such as sea salt aerosols and improved batteries. The behavior of ions near interfaces is an essential aspect of all of these problems. The research has four objectives: to study ions in water, in organic solvents, and in biological channels, and to further develop a new stochastic algorithm for quantum simulations on parallel computers. The study of ions in water leads to the accurate prediction of the effective surface potential of water, a long sought quantity in condensed phase chemistry. This work employs ab initio quantum simulations and quasi-chemical theory to obtain quantitative estimates of the bulk and real hydration free energies. The study of ions in organic solvents applies the same ideas to ions in ethylene carbonate, a key electrolyte in Li-ion batteries. That research improves current models for these systems. The study of ions in biological channels examines the interaction of protons and chloride ions in the bacterial CLC channel protein. The development of stochastic algorithims may lead to a new forward-looking algorithm for large-scale quantum simulations. The method employs stochastic differential equations to solve for the one-particle density matrix.

Conventional DRAM-based memory is facing severe technology scaling limitations such as process variations, which hinders the growth in memory density at reasonable cost. Such challenges inspire the search for alternative memory technologies such as the emerging non-volatile Resistive RAMs (ReRAM). ReRAM exploits resistance of Metal-Oxide-Metal structure to represent stored information. It has shorter read and write latency, and better write endurance when compared with other non-volatile memories. ReRAM exhibits superior scalability and can be architected to build high-density memories using a crossbar structure, or 3D stacking. Such features make ReRAM a competitive technology as a DRAM replacement to achieve significant large memory capacity for modern data intensive applications. Education objectives will be achieved through broad dissemination of results via publications, research seminars, tutorials, software demonstrations, conference participation, and technology transfer initiatives. Continuous student training will be carried through involving graduate, undergraduate students, especially underrepresented students in this research. <br/><br/>There are major difficulties in building a large memory using the crossbar ReRAM architecture.

Alpha-synuclein forms two types of aggregates: mature fibrils and oligomers. The mature fibrils are known to be non-toxic, but oligomers can cause the death of the neuronal cells by forming pore structure in the cell membrane. Understanding the structure of oligomer aggregates should provide clues for the development of therapeutic agents for Parkinson's disease.

In addition, a new laboratory experiment on peptide synthesis for a graduate level organic chemistry class is being developed. <br/><br/>Various techniques have been developed to determine the structure of proteins. Among them, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provides a fast response and has been used to evaluate various conformations (such as alpha-helix, beta-sheet, unstructured conformation) in proteins and peptides. This method utilizes the amide I band, which arises from the stretching mode of the carbonyl group in the backbone amide bonds. Traditional FTIR can only provide information about an overall fraction of the conformations. To expand its capability, 13C labels can be introduced to the carbonyls in the backbone amide bonds and a new band (the 13C amide I band) can be generated to determine the conformation of specific residues. In this project, 13C labels are introduced into the sequence of alpha-synuclein to study the conformation of the oligomers of alpha-synuclein at the residue level. In addition, Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy is used to address the orientation of 13C labeled carbonyls. With both conformation and orientation information, the structure of alpha-synuclein can be evaluated in phospholipid bilayer structures."},{"AwardNumber":"1560020","Title":"REU Site: Enhancing Undergraduate Research Experiences in Mobile Cloud Security","NSFOrganization":"CNS","Program(s)":"RSCH EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD SITES, RES EXP FOR TEACHERS(RET)-SITE, Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace","StartDate":"06/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"02/24/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Feng Li","State":"IN","Organization":"Indiana University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Harriet G.

However, these batteries suffer from safety issues originating from the flammable liquid electrolyte that is used to transport lithium ions within the battery. One of the most promising candidates for a safer, replacement electrolyte is the ceramic lithium lanthanum zirconate (LLZO), which has good thermal/chemical stability and ionic transport properties. Nonetheless, there is still much fundamental research needed in order to improve understanding of several critical issues in LLZO and how to improve its performance. This project investigates novel LLZO nanowire structures and composites with unique nanoscale properties that can improve their conductivity for lithium ions and integration into safer, all-solid-state batteries. This project also supports education and outreach activities that focus on improving the pipeline and retention of female students in science and engineering through hands-on experiences that will increase understanding and retention of engineering concepts and stimulate the students' interests in research. Outreach to local middle school girls through a battery-related challenge to provide context on issues related to electric cars and research opportunities to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students are example activities. Educational efforts include international exchange of teaching methodologies with faculty in South Korea to understand strategies that promote female student achievement, as well as how to best engage students from diverse backgrounds in student-centered learning environments.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This research project aims to correlate composition, grain boundary structure, and crystal phase with ionic conductivity in LLZO nanowire materials prepared using electrospinning. Nanowire solid electrolytes can offer characteristics that are beneficial and advantageous compared to bulk materials - namely milder calcination conditions for crystallization, stabilization of metastable phases, and opportunities for unique structures such as core-shell composites. These characteristics can lead to properties that improve the ionic conductivity, sintering ability, and integration of the electrolytes into all-solid-state batteries. The nanowires are used to understand the LLZO phase stability, crystallization, and sintering processes. Core-shell nanowire structures are used to investigate interfacial properties and transport in composites to understand how to maximize highly conducting pathways for lithium ions and uniformly modify grain boundaries. Additionally, detailed in situ and aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy is used to understand processes such as crystallization of electrospun nanowires, impurity segregation to grain boundaries, sintering in networks of nanowires, and interdiffusion at the electrolyte/cathode interface. This information is being correlated with ionic conductivity and electrochemical cycling tests on the nanowire solid electrolyte materials and compared to bulk materials. The insights gained from this work are enabling better control of composition, stabilization of metastable phases, sintering processes, and Li ion transport, which can ultimately lead to higher ionic conductivity ceramic electrolytes."},{"AwardNumber":"1610109","Title":"Tailoring Size and Shape of beta-Sheet Nanocrystals for Crosslinking and Reinforcement of Elastomers","NSFOrganization":"DMR","Program(s)":"POLYMERS","StartDate":"06/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"03/25/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Li Jia","State":"OH","Organization":"University of Akron","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"Andrew J.

Their applications range from daily goods (for example tires) to defense (for example sonar domes of navy ships) and to biomedicine (for example coatings of artery stents). This NSF-supported research/educational team led by a chemist (Jia) and a physicist/chemical engineer (Foster) combines inspirations from biological systems and lessons from chemical and physical principles to develop the next generation of elastomers. A central focus is to reduce the size of hard particles that strengthen the elastomers to the nanometer scale. The research team will advance our fundamental understanding of how these reinforcing elements produce elastomers that are strong, stiff, and extensible and that have programmed capability to dissipate energy. This scientific knowledge can be used for a number of applications, e.g. tires that are safe, durable, and fuel-efficient. The elastomers developed can also potentially be directly applied to make medical devices safer. Parallel to the research effort, the program will train undergraduate and graduate students in this interdisciplinary area. The team will carry out outreach activities aimed at attracting domestic talent to careers in science and technology and particularly in polymer-related areas using aspects of elastomers as the primary content materials.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY. <br/><br/>The ability to manipulate atoms and molecules to form hierarchical structures with precisely controlled size and shape is central to nanoscience. Beta-sheet nanocrystals exist in both natural and synthetic elastomers and function as crosslinks and provide reinforcement. However, their morphologies are drastically different in these two circumstances. In natural elastomers (i.e., silks), they are particulates with all three dimensions smaller than 10 nm. In synthetic elastomers (e.g., polyurethanes), they have been found to be fibrous with the longest dimension, in the hydrogen-bonding direction, ranging from hundreds of nanometers to microns. In silks, the size control is attributed to specific amino acid sequences and an exquisite reeling process. Controlling the size and aspect ratio of beta-sheet nanocrystals is an unresolved challenge for synthetic systems. This research pursues this central quest of nanoscience in an important area of soft materials, elastomers, to realize material properties otherwise unattainable. The scientific approach of the research is multifaceted, involving synthesis, characterization, and mechanical studies across the molecular, supramolecular, and nanometer scales. Based on their recent success in reducing the longest dimension of n-beta-sheet nanocrystals in a series of oligo(beta-alanine)-grafted polyisobutylenes to well below 100 nm, the research team will expand their ability to regulate the size and aspect ratio of the beta-sheet nanocrystals without an elaborate aminoacid sequence and to elucidate the reinforcing characteristics of the two morphologically contrasting beta-sheet nanocrystals. The polymer brush at the interface of the nanocrystal will be another focus as it is critical for the morphological control and likely plays an important role in reinforcement as well. The specific objectives of the planned research are to: (1) synthesize monodisperse oligo(beta-alanine)-grafted polyisobutylenes that form particulate nanocrystals with still smaller aspect ratios as well as those that form fibrous nanocrystals. (2) characterize the structures and morphologies of the beta-sheet nanocrystals including the polymer brush attached to the nanocrystal surface. (3) elucidate the reinforcing characteristics and study the reinforcing mechanisms of the particulate and fibrous nanocrystals."},{"AwardNumber":"1554468","Title":"CAREER: Mechanics of a New Family of Auxetic Chiral Composites","NSFOrganization":"CMMI","Program(s)":"CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV, Mechanics of Materials and Str","StartDate":"06/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"01/06/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Yaning Li","State":"NH","Organization":"University of New Hampshire","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Kara Peters","EndDate":"05/31/2021","AwardedAmountToDate":"$500,000.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"yaning.li@unh.edu","OrganizationStreet":"51 COLLEGE RD SERVICE BLDG 107","OrganizationCity":"Durham","OrganizationState":"NH","OrganizationZip":"038243585","OrganizationPhone":"6038622172","NSFDirectorate":"ENG","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1045, 1630","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"022E, 024E, 027E, 1045, 1630, 9102, 9150","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will investigate the mechanical behavior of a new family of auxetic chiral composites which have unique deformation mechanisms and can preserve auxetic effects under large deformations.

The southern U.S. near the Gulf Coast and the eastern U.S. bordering the Atlantic experienced two cycles of super-continent formation and break-up. These episodes of collision and rifting altered the crust and mantle lithosphere of the North American plate, thickening these layers in some regions, thinning them in others, and producing distinctive structures by aligning mineral grains and melting small amounts of rock. In this project we will use earthquake waves to construct three-dimensional models of the crust and mantle lithosphere, and we will interpret these models to better understand how continental collision and rifting affect continental lithosphere.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to improve resolution of crust and mantle structure in the southern and eastern U.S. in order to better understand lithospheric evolution and modification through the last Wilson cycle. The southern and eastern margins of the North America continent experienced two complete Wilson cycles of orogeny and rifting, leaving varied signatures of deformation and magmatism in the crust and mantle lithosphere of these regions. However, many aspects of crust and mantle structure remain poorly known at the scales relevant to distinguishing the effects of orogeny, rifting, and other processes such as hotspot interaction. Using data from the NSF EarthScope USArray/Transportable Array (TA), now completed in the contiguous U.S., we propose to image crust and mantle seismic structure in new detail. We will focus on two regions: one spanning the southern craton edge, the entire Ouachita orogeny and the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain, and the other containing the eastern craton edge, the central and northern Appalachians, and the Atlantic coast. We will use seismic data from TA stations, supplemented by other temporary and permanent broadband stations, to image crustal and mantle discontinuities using Sp and Ps receiver functions, construct 3-D anisotropic models based on Rayleigh wave, Love wave and shear-wave-splitting analyses, and we will integrate these data and methods through joint analyses and inversions. The seismic models will be used constrain the style and geometry of deformation in the crust and mantle lithosphere due to the last episodes of orogeny and rifting. This interpretation will be guided by geological and active source indicators of deformation in the shallow crust and by the type and age of magmatism across the region, bearing in mind that some facets of crust and mantle structure may reflect events that predated or followed the last cycle of orogeny and continental rifting. Variations in the impact of orogeny and rifting on the lithosphere will be compared between and within the study regions. The proposed project will support the education and career development of graduate students at the University of Houston and at Brown. It will also contribute to undergraduate senior theses, lab exercises and group research projects in undergraduate and graduate courses, and to science outreach activities with local public schools.

As observers on the outer skin of the Earth, even after four and a half billion years, we see constant reminders of this evolution in the form of earthquakes and volcanoes. Even the distinction between ocean and continent owes its origin to this dynamic process. This study is focused on the enabler of this process - the plastic nature of what we consider hard rocks. Over long times at elevated pressure and temperature, rocks behave as liquids. In recent years, tools have evolved that allow us to measure the viscous character of these hard objects at pressures and temperatures that one finds deep in the Earth. These experiments are built around a synchrotron facility that has been built at a national lab. The investigators will use both the National Synchrotron Light Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. This study will help our understanding of this dynamic evolution of the Earth. A graduate student will be supported and will participate in this research.<br/><br/>MgSiO3 in the perovskite crystal structure (bridgmanite) is the most abundant mineral in the Earth and it's calcium counterpart (CaSiO3) is among the five most abundant minerals. The plastic nature of these minerals defines the fluid character of the deep Earth. These properties are both pressure and temperature dependent, and as of yet, unknown. Knowledge of these properties along with proposed temperature models can help constrain dynamics of the Earth evolution and current state. The plastic properties of these minerals is particularly interesting because these minerals are composed of silicon in six coordination with oxygen, while the bulk of materials studied to date have silicon in four coordination with oxygen. The investigating team proposes to study the mechanical properties of these minerals at conditions of pressure and temperature appropriate to the deep Earth. They will focus on defining a quantitative flow law that expresses the plastic properties of these materials. The plasticity of lower mantle minerals at lower mantle conditions of pressure and temperature has been beyond the experimental reach. This has left us with little mineral-based knowledge of the effective viscosity of the lower mantle at the conditions of the anticipated geotherm. Development of new deformation equipment enables a new effort to characterize the quantitative flow law of the high pressure phases at the extremes of pressure and temperature of the top of the lower mantle. This proposal is to study both the Mg and the Ca end-member silicate perovskite at these conditions. This is made possible by a new facility being installed at the new synchrotron, NSLS II, at the Brookhaven National Laboratories. The new facility will provide world class synchrotron X-ray light for these experiments with a new DT25 guideblock in a 1000 ton hydraulic press with deformation capabilities.

In these plasmas, collisions between charged particles are rare. As a result, plasma waves are a major means of transferring energy from one charged particle population to another. Charged particles ""surf"" the waves. To first order, those that are moving slightly faster than the waves are energized, while those moving slower lose energy to the waves causing them to grow. There are a wide variety of plasma waves with different properties and different source mechanisms. Three of these (plasmaspheric hiss, chorus, and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves) are widely believed to play significant roles in the depletion of the electron radiation belts but how this happens and how each contributes with local time and radial distance are still-open and strongly debated questions of fundamental importance. During their interactions with the waves, electrons are scattered out of their trapped orbits and sent on trajectories into the dense atmosphere where they are lost through collisions. The work will independently examine experimental observations and, most importantly, use theoretical tools to understand the interactions leading to the precipitation. The science questions to be addressed in this proposal are particularly important, since electron precipitation leads to chemical changes in the upper atmosphere, and is critical in regulating ring current and radiation belt electron dynamics. The grant will support the further training and development of a promising female early-career scientist. The results will be useful to the broader space physics and upper atmosphere communities, to researchers studying the chemistry of the middle atmosphere, and for space environment applications, such as active mitigation techniques for both natural and artificial radiation in space.<br/><br/>Testing theoretical ideas about particular wave-particle interactions and the variations in the space environment that effect them has been difficult because the waves are measured at large radial distances in the magnetosphere while the electron precipitation that they produce must be viewed from low-earth orbit. To complicate matters, the mix of plasma waves depends on the radial distance and magnetic local time but in addition is an as yet to be determined function of the severity of space weather storming, and the phase of the storm. The principal investigator (PI) has developed an innovative technique to analyze the physical relationship between wave intensity and wave-driven electron pitch angle scattering loss, which can be directly implemented using conjugate observations from near-equatorial and low-altitude satellites. This project, which uses both theory and observation, will provide a definitive understanding of the quantitative contribution of each type of plasma wave to electron precipitation within various energy ranges and in different L-MLT regions. The results will provide a highly important contribution to our wider understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the hazardous radiation environment surrounding the Earth."},{"AwardNumber":"1555035","Title":"CAREER: Quantum Spin-Optomechanics of Optically Levitated Nanodiamonds","NSFOrganization":"PHY","Program(s)":"AMO Experiment/Atomic, Molecul","StartDate":"05/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"03/29/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Tongcang Li","State":"IN","Organization":"Purdue University","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"John Gillaspy","EndDate":"04/30/2021","AwardedAmountToDate":"$96,789.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"tcli@purdue.edu","OrganizationStreet":"Young Hall","OrganizationCity":"West Lafayette","OrganizationState":"IN","OrganizationZip":"479072114","OrganizationPhone":"7654941055","NSFDirectorate":"MPS","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1241","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"1045, 7237, 8990","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Very small particles can behave in ways that are contrary to common sense. For example, an electron (one of the particles that make up atoms) can be at multiple locations at the same time and can tunnel through a barrier--something forbidden by the classical laws of physics. The theory that explains these counterintuitive behaviors of small particles is ""quantum mechanics"". This CAREER project will investigate the possibility of making quantum mechanics appear manifest in larger, more macroscopic, systems. In specific, the project will investigate how to couple the spin of an electron to the motion of a nanoparticle (containing millions of atoms). The nanoparticle will be levitated by a laser beam in vacuum to avoid perturbations from the environment. This system should serve as a very sensitive force detector with many applications. It may enable other experiments to study the conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics, a longstanding problem in physics. The research will be integrated with several related educational activities, including direct training of graduate and undergraduate students participating in the research, and conducting inquiry workshops about infrared light for middle and high school teachers and students. Infrared light is not visible to human eyes, but plays a crucial role in global warming and fiber-optic communication. In the present work, infrared light will be used to levitate nanoparticles in vacuum. After doing hands-on experiments with infrared light in the workshop, teachers will be able to take their apparatus for use in their classrooms.<br/><br/>In more technical detail, this research project will develop a system that combines the advantages of both trapped atoms and conventional optomechanical systems for studying macroscopic quantum mechanics: an optically levitated nanodiamond with a built-in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. In some ways, this system can be considered to be an ""artificial atom"" with a very large mass. The electron spin of the NV center can be coupled to the motion of the nanodiamond with a magnetic field gradient. This coupling can be used to create large quantum spatial superposition states of the nanodiamond, which will lead to the development of a nanoparticle matter-wave interferometer for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics in unexplored parameter regimes. The main focus of this CAREER project will be to experimentally study the coupling between an NV electron spin and both the center-of-mass motion and the rotation of an optically levitated nanodiamond.

The research will also benefit the Internet of Things, the healthcare, and the consumer electronics industry, because many applications need robust and high capacity batteries. In addition, this project will help train US workforce in the interdisciplinary areas of energy, advanced materials, and advanced manufacturing through the development of interdisciplinary curricula and various science activities for diverse youth. <br/><br/>This research focuses on making 3D electrodes using an aerosol jet-based additive manufacturing method along with nanoparticle sintering. The first research objective is to establish relationships between process parameters and the quality of 3D electrode architecture produced by the processes. Process parameters of aerosol jet-based additive manufacturing include carrier gas pressure, and nanoparticle size and dispersion; and sintering process parameters include sintering energy and time. The quality of 3D electrode architecture will be measured in terms of porosity level, pore geometry, specific capacity, and resistance to capacity fade. This objective will be achieved by carrying out experimental research guided by theoretical models. The solidification of nanoparticle solutions upon dispense and the consecutive sintering process will be modelled by using a discretized particle model and a diffusive model. Further, a model that solves the Li diffusion equation coupled with stress evolution and the cracking in the porous electrode will be developed using a multi-scale modeling approach. These models will guide the additive fabrication experiments using high specific capacity materials such as silicon and silicon dioxide. The second objective is to identify relationships between the characteristics of an artificial coating on the electrode and the resistance to electrode capacity fade. The characteristics of the coating include the thickness and uniformity of the coated layer. To achieve this objective, atomic layer deposition will be used to create an electrode-electrolyte interface layer over the 3D porous electrodes. Several microscopic analyses such as atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy will be used to measure the coating thickness and uniformity. Battery electrochemical experiments will then be carried out and the resistance to capacity fade will be measured using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy."},{"AwardNumber":"1604092","Title":"Symmetry, Integrability, and Special Functions","NSFOrganization":"DMS","Program(s)":"ANALYSIS PROGRAM","StartDate":"05/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"12/18/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Mourad Ismail","State":"FL","Organization":"University of Central Florida","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Edward Taylor","EndDate":"04/30/2017","AwardedAmountToDate":"$25,000.00","Co-PIName(s)":"Xin Li","PIEmailAddress":"ismail@math.ucf.edu","OrganizationStreet":"4000 CNTRL FLORIDA BLVD","OrganizationCity":"ORLANDO","OrganizationState":"FL","OrganizationZip":"328168005","OrganizationPhone":"4078821120","NSFDirectorate":"MPS","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1281","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"7556","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"This award provides funding for the conference Symmetry, Integrability, and Special Functions, to be held at the Centre de Recherches Mathmatiques at the University of Montreal from July 3 to July 9, 2016.<br/><br/>The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of difference equations, orthogonal polynomials, and integrable systems.

Garcia-Garibay of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California-Los Angeles is establishing new synthetic strategies to transform simple chemicals into more complex, high value substances, by taking advantage of reactions that occur under the high order and rigidity of the crystalline state. Their strategy relies on the selection of structures that are known to form highly reactive intermediates when activated by the absorption of ultraviolet light. By executing those reactions in the crystalline state, instead of doing them in liquids, they are able to obtain nearly pure solid products with no need for solvents, catalysts or additional reagents. This project is in the SusChEM portfolio as the reactions do not use solvent and require no energy for the separation and removal of byproducts.

In the solid state, radical-radical combination reactions with retention of stereochemistry, and selective nitrene insertions occur. Photochemical reactions are carried out in well-characterized crystalline phases and their transformations from the solid phase of the reactant to the solid phase of the product are analyzed by thermal analysis and spectroscopic means. This characterization is done in order to determine the corresponding phase diagrams and the conditions required for clean and efficient reactions.

However, dissimilar metals cannot be joined using traditional fusion-based welding methods.

To achieve the first objective, joining samples will be prepared using the two joining processes under various process conditions. Local mechanical properties will be quantified through micro-cantilever, micro-hardness, and in situ scanning electron microscope testing. Joint performance will be measured through macro quasi-static tensile tests.

Among many others, the linear programming (LP) technique has played a central role in the area of approximation algorithms. This project seeks to understand the power of this technique, by exploiting a very flexible paradigm in designing LP-based algorithms, called the ""round-or-cut"" paradigm. The PI aims to use this paradigm to tackle many combinatorial optimizations problems that seem hard to tackle in other ways. Successful completion of the project will not only yield improved approximation algorithms for these problems, but also lead to a better understanding of the power of linear programming technique. As a part of the project, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained and involved in the research activities. The course materials resulting from this research project will be made freely accessible online.<br/><br/>Recently, the round-or-cut paradigm has led to many improved approximation algorithms. This paradigm differs from the traditional ""relax-and-round"" paradigm in that the LP relaxation used to approximate the problem does not need to be efficiently solvable. As a result, the round-or-cut paradigm has the flexibility that the rounding algorithm can adaptively choose the set of linear constraints to require the fractional solution to satisfy. The major goal of this project is to leverage this flexibility to tackle problems that seem hard to tackle using the traditional relax-and-round paradigm, including the capacitated k-median problem, the machine minimization problem on identical machines, and the unsplittable flow problem on paths. The second goal is to understand the gap between the round-or-cut paradigm and the traditional relax-and-round paradigm. So far, the relax-and-round paradigm is far more popular than the round-or-cut paradigm in designing LP-based approximation algorithms. For a few problems only, algorithms require the stronger round-or-cut paradigm. The PI will investigate whether the relax-and-round paradigm is sufficient for these problems."},{"AwardNumber":"1565928","Title":"CRII: SHF: FSM-Centric Approximate Computing --- A Disciplined Approach","NSFOrganization":"CCF","Program(s)":"CRII CISE Research Initiation","StartDate":"03/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"02/16/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Zhijia Zhao","State":"CA","Organization":"University of California-Riverside","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Tao Li","EndDate":"02/28/2018","AwardedAmountToDate":"$175,000.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"zhijia@cs.ucr.edu","OrganizationStreet":"Office of Research","OrganizationCity":"RIVERSIDE","OrganizationState":"CA","OrganizationZip":"925211000","OrganizationPhone":"9518275535","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"026Y","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"7798, 7941, 8228","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"This project proposes a new paradigm to enhance computing efficiency --- Finite State Machine (FSM)-centric approximate computing. Approximate computing has shown promise for both reducing energy consumption and improving performance across different applications, especially those in image processing, machine learning and data analytics.

Growing data volumes and limitations on computer processing power constrain FSM?s efficiency. The establishment of FSM-centric approximate computing will open the door to a new dimension of efficiency optimization for software applications.<br/><br/>This research will take advantage of the synergy between FSM computations and approximate computing --- the inherent error tolerance capability within FSM computations --- to develop a computing platform for exploring approximate FSM computations. The key idea is a quantitative analysis of FSM reliability that captures how errors generated by underlying approximate hardware propagate through FSM transitions.

Increasingly demanding programs are run by users on handheld platforms powered by batteries. Therefore, specialized hardware components, i.e., IP cores, are introduced to improve handhelds? energy efficiency. However, the memory access patterns of CPUs and IPs are dramatically different, making main memory a critical bottleneck for a handheld system. Non-volatile memories, particularly STT-MRAM, are emerging as replacements for the existing DRAM-based main memory, achieving a wide variety of advantages. Nevertheless, substituting DRAM with STT-MRAM in handhelds also results in new design challenges such as read disturbance. Consequently, two read disturbance mitigation schemes are proposed in this project, constructing a high performance and reliable memory framework for handheld platforms.<br/><br/>In this research, a flexible STT-MRAM read scheme, namely FlexRead, is proposed to optimize handheld platform performance and energy efficiency under read disturbance. FlexRead combines the advantages of two existing data sensing schemes, dynamically issuing the best sensing scheme based on the runtime system state. Furthermore, an application flow pattern prediction scheme, namely FlowPaP, is proposed to identify and remove unnecessary memory restores originally required for preventing read disturbance. FlowPaP analyzes the data flow behavior in the applications running on handhelds, recognizing that the memory is in a consistent loop of being alternately written and read. These two proposed schemes optimize multiple handheld platform design aspects, thus having a transformational impact on the handheld research community, industrial products, and even society. The discovered read disturbance issue is an important and realistic design challenge for future handheld platform generations.

However, high levels of distributed energy resources can change the behavior of the grid, with potential undesirable effects on the grid stability and power quality. This necessitates transformative approaches to coordinate the large number of distributed energy resources. These approaches need to handle the high uncertainty involved in the renewable generation and to call upon customers to actively participate. Additional challenges are placed by the still-undeveloped sensing, communication, and computation resources for the grid. To address these challenges, this CAREER proposal is to develop distributed coordination rules to optimize, control, and incentivize the distributed energy resources in order to ensure efficient, adaptive, and reliable performance of the grid. The proposal will integrate multidisciplinary approaches, in particular, mathematics, engineering, and economics. Results can also be transferred to other large-scale socio-technical systems, such as transportation systems and water/gas distribution systems. Broad impacts will follow from an integrated educational dissemination plan, involvement of undergraduates especially under-represented groups in research, transition of new ideas to industry, and outreach to the general public and K-12 students.<br/><br/>As a socio-technical system, two factors distinguish the power grid from other networks, its intrinsic physics and its close human interactions. Accordingly, this proposal will design automated distributed algorithms to optimize the performance of the energy resources at slow-time scales and to control them to ensure energy balance at fast-time scales, and design incentive schemes such as pricing, rewards, payoff, and trading rules to promote human participants to take desired actions. The automated algorithms will tackle the challenges brought by the power system physics (e.g. physical laws such as Kirchhoff's law and system dynamics such as swing dynamics), limited communication, and uncertain generation/consumption. The algorithms will also maximize the use of physics in order to lower sensing, communication, and computation overhead. The incentive schemes will tackle the challenges brought by the self-interested nature of humans. Owners of distributed energy resources are mostly profit-maximizing entities, seeking their own best interest and lacking incentives to reveal truthful private information. Lastly the proposal will jointly design the distributed architecture, algorithms and incentive schemes by strongly integrating the engineering and economics in order to ensure high-performance and high-confidence operation of distributed energy resources to facilitate a smoother transition for the grid into the next age of a smarter grid."},{"AwardNumber":"1553042","Title":"CAREER: Trading Communication and Storage for Computation to Enhance Energy Efficiency","NSFOrganization":"CCF","Program(s)":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION","StartDate":"02/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"01/29/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Ulya Karpuzcu","State":"MN","Organization":"University of Minnesota-Twin Cities","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"Tao Li","EndDate":"01/31/2021","AwardedAmountToDate":"$170,354.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"ukarpuzc@umn.edu","OrganizationStreet":"200 OAK ST SE","OrganizationCity":"Minneapolis","OrganizationState":"MN","OrganizationZip":"554552070","OrganizationPhone":"6126245599","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"7798","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"1045, 7941","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Looking forward, a fundamental challenge in computer systems is the Power Wall, where, due to imbalances in technology scaling, not all the compute engines that find place on chip can be powered on at the same time. The Power Wall is transforming all levels of the system stack, including the parallel architecture landscape. Communication power, as induced by data movement and the orchestration thereof, along with storage power, dominates computation power. As the degree of concurrency increases, communication power becomes even more prominent due to more frequent data transfers. At the same time, emerging memory technologies are not mature enough to keep up with the corresponding capacity, bandwidth, and performance requirements within a tight power budget. An amnesic processor, can minimize, if not eliminate, the power and performance overhead associated with data storage, retrieval, and communication, thus, operate more energy efficiently. The limited storage of the amnesic machine represents the short-term memory, which lacks long-term memory by construction.<br/><br/>When compared to its classic counterparts, an amnesic machine can facilitate more compute engines to occupy the area once devoted to (long-term) memory, which can further be harnessed for recomputation. Recomputation can transparently convert workloads to become more compute intensive such that they can make a better use of classic architectures optimized for performance, as opposed to energy efficiency. This project intends to unlock the energy efficiency premise of amnesic machines. To this end, the PI proposes to explore compiler and microarchitecture support to decide when to replace remote loads with re-computation. The research has three major thrusts: (i) at compiler time, integer linear programming based optimization will be performed to generate a probabilistic energy-minimal re-computation schedule; (ii) runtime controller will be designed to decide when to re-compute based on the information the compiler provides; and (iii) memory hierarchy will also be explored to maximize energy efficiency.

Fleming of the Department of Chemistry at Duquesne University will explore fundamentally new reactions of metalated nitriles. Preliminary results demonstrate the viability of several new reactivity patterns for alkylating alkenes, aromatics, and creating medium-sized carbocycles. Studies to expand and develop these forays into robust synthetic methods will be undertaken. Asymmetric alkylations of zincated and magnesiated nitriles will be performed through a combination of screening and mechanistic probes to address one of the most difficult challenges in the field: stereoselective alkylation of a chiral, metalated nitrile.<br/><br/>The research is likely to lead to new methods for stereoselectively assembling hindered, quaternary centers. Fields as diverse as medicine and materials rely on exactly this type of robust chemistry. The nitrile-based arylation is particularly well suited to the synthesis of several nitrile-containing pharmaceuticals and drug leads because the method uses an inexpensive, abundant copper catalyst rather than palladium catalysts that are currently required for the same transformation.<br/><br/>Three broader impacts will be reached through this research: institutional development, elevation of nitrile chemistry, and student training. As a teacher-scholar institution a strong emphasis is placed on undergraduate and graduate mentoring while pursuing research excellence.

Hydrous minerals in the slab break down when exposed to the high temperatures encountered at depth, releasing fluids ultimately involved in the creation of arc magmas and explosive arc volcanoes. In addition, these fluids are also thought to influence seismic slip behavior and the manifestation of earthquakes. Therefore, determining the sources and amount of fluids released at depth within a subduction is critical for understanding volcanic and earthquake behavior along plate margins.<br/><br/>Particular elements (for example, lithium, chlorine, and boron) are highly fluid-mobile, thereby making them excellent tracers of fluid source. These fluids impart diagnostic geochemical signatures to overlying material that can be used to trace mass transfer through subduction zones. This work will geochemically characterize cold and thermal spring waters from the Hikurangi (New Zealand subduction zone) accretionary prism to trace fluid sources along the fore-arc and quantify volatile flux through the fore-arc. Fluid sources to the fore-arc will be determined by examining variations in elemental concentrations (and ratios) and isotopic compositions. The data will be used to evaluate causal links between fluid sources and earthquake mechanics, such as shallow slow slip events. The Hikurangi margin is the ideal locality for this study due to the numerous exposed fore-arc springs, which allow a rare glimpse into the shallow part of the subduction zone, and the previously documented along arc variability in subduction parameters (e.g., amount of subducting sediment) and seismic slip behavior. Geochemical evidence for increased (or more shallow) dehydration reactions in the northern portion of the margin compared to the southern portion would support a link between dehydration reactions and shallow slow slip events."},{"AwardNumber":"1549618","Title":"STTR Phase I: Non-Touch Infant Vital Sign Monitor","NSFOrganization":"IIP","Program(s)":"STTR PHASE I","StartDate":"01/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"12/21/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Yiran Li","State":"TX","Organization":"yearONE LLC","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Jesus Soriano Molla","EndDate":"12/31/2016","AwardedAmountToDate":"$225,000.00","Co-PIName(s)":"Changzhi Li","PIEmailAddress":"yiran.li@ttu.edu","OrganizationStreet":"15527 Baybrook Dr","OrganizationCity":"Houston","OrganizationState":"TX","OrganizationZip":"770628111","OrganizationPhone":"7133034757","NSFDirectorate":"ENG","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1505","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"1505, 8018, 8038, 8042","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase-I project is to improve the detection of cessation of respiration with regard to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

A provocative study of the lithium isotopic composition of the oldest minerals on Earth - the >4.0 billion year old zircons from ancient sedimentary rocks in the Jack Hills, western Australia, reported highly variable isotopic compositions. In particular, the very light Li observed in some of these zircons was suggested to reflect intense chemical weathering of the earliest crust on Earth, implying high surface temperatures, possibly acidic waters and intense rainfall. This interpretation, however, rests on the assumption that Li in zircon faithfully records the isotopic composition of the magma from which they crystallized and has not been influenced by processes such as Li diffusion through the zircon. In this project, the team seeks to quantify whether Li diffuses in natural zircons and under what conditions. They will do this with a two-pronged approach: a) in situ analyses of Li isotopes in natural zircons that show chemically distinct cores and rims, and b) by experimental investigations of synthetic, Li-bearing zircons that have been subjected to heating under different conditions. The results should lead to the more general use of Li isotopes in zircon as a speedometer for geologic processes and for tracing the origins of magmas. <br/><br/>2)<br/>Researchers seek to investigate under what circumstances Li diffuses in the mineral zircon. Unusually light Li isotopes iin ancient zircons from the Hadean eon of Earth history (>4.0 billion years) have been interpreted to reflect incorporation of highly weathered materials into the sources of the granitic magmas in which the zircons are inferred to have crystallized. The implication is that the Hadean Earth had continents that rose above sea level and that this crust was exposed to intense chemical weathering due to high surface temperatures, acidic water and intense rainfall. An alternative interpretation, supported by experimentally determined diffusion coefficients for Li in zircon, is that the light Li was generated via kinetic fractionation during Li diffusion. However, most natural zircons show no evidence for Li diffusion, for example, they show no progressive zoning in Li isotopes (within the 10-25 m resolution of ion probe spots), and they show abrupt concentration steps in Li. Unraveling which of these interpretations is correct has important implications for understanding the Hadean Earth. This team will undertake an investigation of both natural and synthesized zircons in order to address the question of whether Li readily diffuses in zircon. Natural zircons whose Li distribution has been mapped using time of flight (ToF) SIMS will be analyzed for their isotopic compositions using NanoSIMS to see if there is any evidence of Li diffusion across sharp Li concentration boundaries. Zircons synthesized under a variety of pressure, temperature and rare earth element concentrations, will be characterized for their P and REE concentrations and distributions. These synthetic zircons will then be exposed to variable Li concentrations, and heating experiments followed by analyses of their isotopic compositions, as well as Si, Sc, Ti, and Y concentrations using NanoSIMS. The results of this project will lead to a much better understanding of Li diffusion in zircon, which, in turn, will open the door towards using Li in zircon to trace sources of evolved igneous rocks (if Li diffusion is found to be insignificant), the timescale of magmatic processes (if Li diffusion commonly occurs), or possibly both if Li diffusion occurs in some instances, but not in others. It is conceivable that both may occur, depending on the atomic Li/REE ratios of the zircon of interest."},{"AwardNumber":"1600896","Title":"CAREER: Approximate Computing Systems for Future Teraflops Workloads","NSFOrganization":"CCF","Program(s)":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION","StartDate":"08/21/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"10/14/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Nam Sung Kim","State":"IL","Organization":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"Tao Li","EndDate":"12/31/2016","AwardedAmountToDate":"$91,231.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"nskim@illinois.edu","OrganizationStreet":"SUITE A","OrganizationCity":"CHAMPAIGN","OrganizationState":"IL","OrganizationZip":"618207473","OrganizationPhone":"2173332187","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"7798","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"1045","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"The performance of computers has improved tremendously in the past four decades, which has enabled innumerable applications that have major roles in our daily lives. However, without dramatic innovations in improving power efficiency of computing, the continued semiconductor device scaling alone will fail to provide sufficient performance for the future computing capabilities.

The novelty of the approach lies in developing power- and performance-efficient computing systems with software support by exploiting the characteristics of future workloads that often use complex probabilistic mathematical models of physical phenomena. In such applications, approximate computing can often result in satisfactory outcomes. Meanwhile, it can dramatically decrease power consumption or increase performance by replacing complete logic functions with simplified circuits that mimic the functions for rough calculations. To extend the approximate computing concept to more general-purpose computing systems, the following holistic approaches are proposed: 1) intelligent microarchitectures to identify correctness-non-critical regions of code with compiler support; 2) approximate computing engines to execute such regions of code power and performance efficiently; 3) high-level morphic primitives to process a large fraction of workloads with orders-of-magnitude greater power and performance efficiency; and 4) flexible architectures to allow programmers and users to trade the quality of computing with the efficiency. <br/><br/>The proposed research will have a specific and significant impact on the computer architecture, circuit, and compiler communities since it requires analysis of interesting and representative workloads; realization of state-of-the-art circuit, architecture, and compiler infrastructure; and invention of powerful and useful evaluation methodologies.

Plants, including crops, respond to cues from the environment in many ways. Among these responses are changes in the ways that genes are expressed. Understanding and manipulating these changes are likely to be profitable means for improving crop productivity. The subject of this research is a protein (termed AtCPSF30) that is important for the responses of plants to environmental stresses, as well as to other cues (or developmental signals) that guide development from a seedling to a mature and productive plant. The goals of the research are to understand how this protein helps the plant to discriminate between different cues, so that subsequent changes in gene expression are appropriate to the respective stress or developmental signal. This research will lead to a better understanding of how plants respond to environmental stresses, and to how stresses affect different aspects of growth and development. This understanding will allow scientists to develop improved crop varieties, and will help producers to make informed decisions regarding crop and variety choice, as well as production management. <br/><br/>Technical description of the project:<br/><br/>The subject of this study is a hypothetical hub that transduces cellular signaling cues into differential poly(A) site choices and phenotypic outcomes. This hub, the 30 kD subunit of the so-called Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor in Arabidopsis (AtCPSF30), is regulated in vitro by two distinctive chemical or biochemical signals (calcium and redox signals), and is involved in a range of developmental and physiological responses.

Room-temperature rechargeable Na-ion batteries can be competitive to Li-ion batteries due to their lower cost and the widespread availability of the sodium resources. While tremendous research is focused on Li-ion batteries worldwide, scientific challenges associated with room-temperature rechargeable sodium-ion batteries have been relatively unexplored. This is of prime importance considering that Li resources are very limited and their price has increased continuously during the past 20 years. The challenges of Na-ion batteries are much more complicated than the Li-ion case, as Na-ions are larger than Li-ions by 70 percent, which induces large mechanical stresses upon driving the Na-ions into the host electrode. The entry of sodium into the electrodes triggers complicated chemical reactions and failures that are poorly understood, and the battery life is reduced drastically.<br/><br/>An important challenge in the broad use of Na-ion batteries is the very low cycling stability in service conditions.

On the other hand, many licensed spectrum blocks are left unused. Although cognitive radios (CR) technology has emerged as an enabler for unlicensed users to opportunistically access the unused licensed spectrum, most previous works commonly assume that each user is equipped with a CR which can operate across a wide range of spectrum. This may be possible in theory, but may not be practical for light-weight devices such as cell phones. How to effectively utilize the CR technology to build more flexible networks so that even non-CR capable devices can benefit from the opportunistic access to the unused spectrum is therefore in dire need.<br/><br/>In this project, the PIs propose a novel cognitive mesh assisted cellular network (CMCN) and investigate: 1) the architectural design of CMCN so that unoccupied licensed spectrum can be efficiently utilized and non-cognitive cellular devices can benefit from the CR technology, 2) spectrum and energy efficient CR mesh router placement under uncertain spectrum availability, 3) how to construct a fine-grained spectrum map to facilitate efficient spectrum allocation and intelligent traffic delivery, and 4) experimental validation and implementation for the proposed design. The research outcome provides a viable solution to the spectrum congestion in cellular systems. Moreover, with this flexible architecture, telecommunication industries can be rejuvenated with new innovations, leading to further development of cellular networks with high capacity and better support of new applications such as mobile healthcare, which has significant impact on individuals' lives and further provides greater opportunities for job creation and economic growth.

A typical CPS consists of physical dynamics, sensors, communication network and controllers. The communication network is of key importance in CPS, since it mimics the nerve system in the human body. Hence, it is critical to study how the communication network in CPS should be analyzed and designed. Essentially, communications stem from the uncertainty of system under consideration; random perturbations increase the system uncertainty, which is reduced by the control actions in CPS. It is well known that entropy is a measure of system uncertainty. A unified framework of entropy is used for CPS, in which random perturbations create entropy while communications and controls provide negative entropy to compensate the entropy generation. The intellectual merits are the novel framework of entropy for bridging the communications and control in CPS and the new design criterion based on the entropy of system state for CPS. The project's broader significance and importance are the education of various levels of students, the dissemination of results to public, and the impact on everyday life such as the improved agility and robustness of power grids.<br/><br/>This project applies the framework of entropy to study the interdependencies of communications and control, thus facilitating the analysis and design of communications in CPS. The following tasks are tackled in the project: (a) Entropy Flow Based Communication Capacity Analysis in which communications in CPS is analyzed by studying the entropy fields in the physical dynamics, thus providing an estimation on the scale (bits/second) of communication capacity budget; (b) Communication Network Topology Design in which the design of the network topology (either physical or logical) is tackled through both optimization-based or heuristic approaches; (c) Online Network Resource Scheduling which refines the network resource scheduling during the operation using both optimization-based and heuristic approaches, within the framework of entropy fields; (d) Hardware Emulation Testbed which delivers a co-simulation testbed based on real time digital power simulator (RTDS) and a communication simulator, in the context of smart grids.

This variability raises issues regarding proper pricing mechanisms for electric power in systems with high levels of renewable generation. The research objective of this project is to explore a new fundamental market-based mechanism for managing the uncertainty caused by high levels of renewable generation or renewable energy sources (RES). The key concept of the proposed mechanism is to charge uncertain sources and credit flexible sources based on Uncertainty Marginal Price (UMP), which represents the marginal cost of immunizing the next increment of uncertainty at a specific location. Management of uncertainty is one of the key issues that must be dealt with to have seamless high-level penetration of RES. The clear price signals and incentives developed in this project have the potential to remove a critical barrier to distributed RES, which in turn will promote energy independence and reduce environmental impact, contributing to the goal of a low-carbon economy. The proposed UMP concept enriches the fundamentals of electricity market theory and opens a new door for future research.<br/><br/>This research project will, for the first time, provide explicit price signals and utilize a market mechanism to manage any level of uncertainty using a robust optimization framework.

UMP provides important price signals for both the<br/>market operation and investment related to uncertainty and flexibility. In the short term, the proposed market-based mechanism provides incentives for RES operators to improve forecasting accuracy (i.e., to reduce uncertainties). It also provides incentives for existing flexible resources (e.g., gas-fired generating units) to contribute reserves for uncertainty accommodation. In the long term, the proposed mechanism provides price signals for siting new flexible resources (e.g., energy storage) to accommodate uncertainties from increasing RES penetration."},{"AwardNumber":"1522768","Title":"Novel Ideas and Analysis for Interface and Fluid-Structure Interaction Problems and Applications","NSFOrganization":"DMS","Program(s)":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS","StartDate":"09/15/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"09/11/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Zhilin Li","State":"NC","Organization":"North Carolina State University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Leland M.

Recently, this question has been brought to the forefront by climate change and landscape conversion. Due to the processes of climate change, habitat regions suitable for population growth of many species have been shifting geographically. Climatically induced shifts may interface with population demographic processes in complex ways, setting the stage for impacts on species population growth and spread, long-term dynamics and interactions between species. This project aims to produce new frameworks for the analysis of persistence and spreading speeds of species in a shifting habitat. It addresses the question of how ecosystems are being affected by climate change and how ecosystems might respond in the future. It contributes to the growing body of information identifying species at a high risk for extinction and predicting the spread of invasive species under ongoing climate change. The outcomes of the project help improve strategies for coping with challenges of natural resource management. This project further stimulates interdisciplinary collaboration between mathematicians and biologists to address issues beyond the reach of single disciplines. In addition, it contributes to human resources development, focusing on training and skill development of graduate students, and providing them with experience in interdisciplinary interaction and exploration. <br/><br/>In this project, the investigator formulates and analyzes spatial population models that describe species growth, interactions, and dispersal in shifting habitats. The goal is to understand and accurately describe how climate change affects biological invasion processes. Multi-species reaction-diffusion competition models and predator-prey models, as well as semi-discrete stage-structured spatial models with a shifting habitat edge, are studied to emphasize the role of changing habitat suitability in persistence and spread of an invasive species interacting with an existing species. In these models, shifts in habitat ranges are incorporated in species growth functions that propagate as traveling waves. Species spatial dynamics are investigated for the following cases: (i) one species spreads into a shifting habitat preoccupied by a resident species; and (ii) two species consecutively invade an open shifting habitat and the earlier species is still in the process of expanding its spatial range. New techniques are developed to determine the behaviors of solutions of the models on appropriate bounded and unbounded spatial intervals that expand and shift in time. Methods from differential equations, integral equations, and dynamical systems are employed to detect conditions under which species go extinct and to determine spreading speeds of persisting species in space. The results of this research also have impacts in other disciplines where wave propagation is studied."},{"AwardNumber":"1525485","Title":"IUSE: Collaborative Project: Engaged Student Learning: Design and Development, Level I: Broadening the Path to the STEM Profession Through Cybersecurity Learning","NSFOrganization":"DUE","Program(s)":"IUSE","StartDate":"09/15/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"09/11/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Xiangyang Li","State":"MD","Organization":"Johns Hopkins University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Michael Erlinger","EndDate":"08/31/2018","AwardedAmountToDate":"$150,001.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"xyli@jhu.edu","OrganizationStreet":"3400 N CHARLES ST","OrganizationCity":"Baltimore","OrganizationState":"MD","OrganizationZip":"212182608","OrganizationPhone":"4105168668","NSFDirectorate":"EHR","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1998","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"8209, 9178, SMET","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"The significance and importance of this project resides in the diversification and broadening of the STEM talent pipeline in cybersecurity in predominantly undergraduate and liberal arts schools (small institutions).

Interested students can study further by taking two cybersecurity focused courses and cybersecurity capstone projects created by this project. Using all these materials students can create a cybersecurity concentration. Second, the project will use the Global Environment for Network Innovation (GENI) infrastructure in the development of empirical labs and the capstone project assignments. GENI offers an affordable cloud solution to small institutions that lack the infrastructure to support sophisticated computer labs. The learning impact of the new curriculum will be evaluated by quantitative competency assessments that are administered yearly. Student cybersecurity persistence will be assessed by a longitudinal study of the number of cybersecurity courses taken during a student's course of study. Qualitative assessment of the curriculum will take the form of student interviews and focus groups to gauge attitude towards course modules, perception of learning gains and comfort level with the pedagogies employed. In addition to the collaboration of three college level institutions, this project will leverage relationships with local community colleges to further develop a cybersecurity workforce. This partnership provides a diverse set of students that will support the evidence-based evaluation of student cybersecurity learning via this approach."},{"AwardNumber":"1557727","Title":"QuBBD: Collaborative Research: Advancing mHealth using Big Data Analytics: Statistical and Dynamical Systems Modeling of Real-Time Adaptive m-Intervention for Pain","NSFOrganization":"DMS","Program(s)":"","StartDate":"09/15/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"09/10/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Jingyi Jessica Li","State":"CA","Organization":"University of California-Los Angeles","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Nandini Kannan","EndDate":"08/31/2016","AwardedAmountToDate":"$33,762.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"jli@stat.ucla.edu","OrganizationStreet":"11000 Kinross Avenue, Suite 211","OrganizationCity":"LOS ANGELES","OrganizationState":"CA","OrganizationZip":"900952000","OrganizationPhone":"3107940102","NSFDirectorate":"MPS","ProgramElementCode(s)":"O402","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"With the growing popularity of mobile phone technology, new opportunities have arisen for real-time adaptive medical intervention. The simultaneous growth of multiple ""big data"" sources (e.g., mobile health data, electronic health records, lab test results, genomic data) allows for the development of personalized recommendations. This award supports initiation of a collaborative research project that will generate a new mathematical model for changes in subjective pain over time in patients with chronic conditions. The model will be combined with statistical techniques to ultimately obtain optimized, continuously-updated treatment plans balancing competing demands of pain reduction and medication minimization. Those resulting personalized treatment plans will be incorporated into a currently active pilot study on mobile intervention in patients living with chronic pain due to sickle cell disease (SCD). Since nearly a quarter of patient visits to the emergency room are for conditions that could have been managed as outpatients, it is crucial to improve mobile health technologies to allow these patients to quickly recognize and receive appropriate health care information. <br/><br/>There currently is no standard algorithm or analytical method for real-time adaptive treatment recommendations for chronic conditions like pain. Furthermore, current state-of-the-art methods have difficulty in handling continuous-time decision optimization using big data. The proposed model will consist of a dynamical systems approach using differential equations to forecast future pain levels, as well as a statistical approach tying system parameters to patient data (including reported pain levels, medication history, personal characteristics and other health records). A third key component will be the development and pilot study of a new control and optimization strategy to balance the competing demands of pain reduction and drug dosage minimization.

Some applications involve long-term exposure to blood, such as heart valve replacements and stents. Other applications require intermediate-term or short-term contact. These include applications such as blood storage and medical procedures like dialysis and blood oxygenation. The materials used in these applications induce undesirable (and potentially catastrophic) blood-material interactions, such as blood clotting and inflammation. In fact, the only known surface that is compatible with flowing whole blood for long-term contact is the inside surfaces of blood vessels. This work will develop new surfaces that have chemical and structural features designed to mimic the inside surfaces of blood vessels. We will also study how the chemistry and structure of these new surfaces can be tuned to control interactions with important blood proteins that regulate blood-material interactions, like clotting. This will enable us to better design materials for blood-contacting applications.<br/><br/>This work will prepare dense polymer brushes containing glycosaminoglycans, which are the polyanionic polysaccharides in the endothelial glycocalyx presented by the cells lining blood vessel walls. The interactions of important blood proteins with these glycocalyx mimics will be investigated by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy experiments. These experiments will be used to test new hypotheses about how blood-compatibility is determined by protein-surface interactions and protein-protein interactions at surfaces. Finally we will demonstrate that glycocalyx mimics result in reduced platelet adhesion and activation, and decrease the propensity for blood to clot.<br/><br/>This work will lead to better understanding of the mechanisms whereby interactions of blood components with blood vessel walls prevent blood clotting. By understanding how the blood vessel wall prevents clotting we can better design blood-contacting surfaces for many applications in cardiovascular medicine and biotechnology. The findings from this research could also lead to advances in handling other complex protein mixtures in applications such as protein separation for the food and biopharmaceutical industries. Our education and outreach activities will include a one-week summer short course for middle school students, a symposium for a middle school students at a charter school that serves low-income and minority students, and contributions to a new textbook being authored by a co-PI."},{"AwardNumber":"1511941","Title":"SusChem: Collaborative Research: Role of Biofilms in Engineered Infiltration Systems in the Removal of Bacteria in Urban Stormwater","NSFOrganization":"CBET","Program(s)":"ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","StartDate":"08/15/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"08/21/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Yusong Li","State":"NE","Organization":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"William Cooper","EndDate":"07/31/2018","AwardedAmountToDate":"$33,397.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"yli7@unl.edu","OrganizationStreet":"2200 Vine St, 151 Whittier","OrganizationCity":"Lincoln","OrganizationState":"NE","OrganizationZip":"685031435","OrganizationPhone":"4024723171","NSFDirectorate":"ENG","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1440","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"021E, 8248, 9150","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"1511915(Chen) & 1511941(Li)<br/><br/>Urbanization has resulted in a significant increase in surfaces which prevent stormwater from infiltrating the subsurface and recharging the groundwater.

A disruptive event in Bangkok can stop production in Beijing, and in turn hamper product delivery in Boston. Such events materialize in various, sometimes unexpected forms: natural disasters, labor protests, utility outage, cyber-attacks, political shifts, and epidemic outbreaks, to name a few. They can lead to cascading supply chain failures and business continuity interruptions, with potentially severe near- and long-term physical, financial, and reputational consequences. The key barrier to the effective management of supply chain disruptions is the limited visibility into the interconnected supply network structure and the associated risk profiles. For example, the Department of Defense has specifically highlighted limited visibility of supply chain structures and risks as items of high strategic risks in 2015. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project directly addresses this challenge. It develops predictive analytics, risk learning and mitigation strategies that can be readily deployed by firms and organizations to increase visibility and control of their supply chain risks. The data driven approach is particularly useful to organizations with complex supply chains, such as multinational firms and governmental agencies, to better measure the distribution and impact of supply network risks, and proactively manage such risks and achieve better supply chain resilience.<br/><br/>While existing theories assume perfect knowledge of supply network structure and the associated risk profiles, this research follows a two-pronged approach to directly account for and mitigate limited visibility. First, it develops a series of empirical models that increase visibility into supply chain risks and their driving factors, with a particular emphasis on network-driven risk interdependencies. It is the first research to combine automated textual analysis (topic coding and sentiment analysis) and high-dimensional statistical analysis, to isolate supply risk information from large scale, qualitative data. Specifically, the project will quantify the language of corporate disclosures and user generated content on social media to 1) characterize risk distributions and interdependencies, 2) quantify the impacts of these risks on both immediate and sub-tier supply chain partners, and 3) identify early-warning factors and develop predictive models for risk events. Second, leveraging insights gained from the empirical results, this project develops new quantitative models on risk learning and mitigation that address and account for limited visibility. One class of models focuses on optimal risk learning given complete knowledge of supply network but incomplete knowledge of risks. The other class of models focuses on designing optimal risk mitigation strategies with general incomplete information. The model addresses effectiveness of direct (procuring excess inventory and multi-sourcing) versus indirect (supply contracts) mitigation strategies in a game-theoretic framework."},{"AwardNumber":"1511915","Title":"SusChEM: Collaborative Research: Role of Biofilms in Engineered Infiltration Systems in the Removal of Bacteria in Urban Stormwater","NSFOrganization":"CBET","Program(s)":"ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","StartDate":"08/15/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"08/21/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Kai Loon Chen","State":"MD","Organization":"Johns Hopkins University","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"William Cooper","EndDate":"07/31/2018","AwardedAmountToDate":"$115,877.00","Co-PIName(s)":"Sarah Preheim","PIEmailAddress":"kailoon.chen@jhu.edu","OrganizationStreet":"3400 N CHARLES ST","OrganizationCity":"Baltimore","OrganizationState":"MD","OrganizationZip":"212182608","OrganizationPhone":"4105168668","NSFDirectorate":"ENG","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1440","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"021E, 8248","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"1511915(Chen) & 1511941(Li)<br/><br/>Urbanization has resulted in a significant increase in surfaces which prevent stormwater from infiltrating the subsurface and recharging the groundwater.

The focus of this project is on the fabrication of such icosahedral quasicrystalline nanoparticles. Application of these particles in self assembly is expected to result in a three dimensional icosahedral quasicrystalline pattern, and will aid in understanding the importance of factors affecting the stability of icosahedral quasicrystalline structure.

Notably CU accepts many first generation college students. This work gives these students a rare opportunity to observe and participate in scientific research and discovery, stimulating their interest toward, and boosting their confidence in developing careers in science and technology. It also adds to the enrichment of our knowledge in the field of nanotechnology in the form of peer-reviewed publications and presentations at conferences. Additionally the project is integrated into eight undergraduate physics and nanotechnology courses, directly impacting the education of approximately one hundred students per year.

Experimental conditions are adjusted to generate particles of either spherical or dodecahedral pentagonal morphologies for different applications. Out of multiple potential applications, the researchers focus on studying self-assembly of said nanoparticles. Due to the unique dodecahedral pentagonal morphology of the selected nanoparticles, assembly of a three dimensional icosahedral quasicrystalline structure is expected.

Toward this goal, Professor Freedman is using synthetic chemistry with the aim of addressing the fundamental questions surrounding the creation of a qubit at the molecular level. Professor Freedman will integrate research and education through three new initiatives. In the first initiative, the primary literature will be incorporated into the introductory chemistry curriculum through a combination of demonstrations, lecture examples and student created Wikipedia pages. In a separate initiative, Professor Freedman will continue her work with the Museum of Science and Industry to design and implement a new exhibit, which features her research on magnetic anisotropy.

Electronic spin is an appealing qubit candidate because the qubits can be manipulated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and their parameters can be tuned using chemical synthesis.

As such, the synthesis and fundamental study of molecules with long-lived quantum coherences necessitates rational synthetic design principles to inform and enable the design of future long-lived qubits.

Glutamate is one such molecule, which is not only an amino acid needed for the synthesis of proteins, but also the most important neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, responsible for the majority of excitatory neurotransmission. Glutamate is transported across the plasma membrane through active glutamate transporters, which play essential roles in controlling the levels of glutamate in the mammalian brain and other tissue. This project explores the fundamental principles by which these transporters work. Understanding these principles is important because it will contribute to our knowledge not only of the role of glutamate and nutrient movement between cellular compartments in the mammalian brain, as well as other organs of the body, but also glutamate homeostasis, which is important for cellular function in general. Furthermore, the developed methods for analyzing transport will be applicable to potential future studies of other neurotransmitter and/or nutrient transporters and membrane proteins. On the educational level, the project provides an invaluable opportunity for undergraduate students to become involved in cutting-edge biophysical research, providing training in basic physical, quantitative approaches to be applied to a significant biological problem. The investigator is continuing previous efforts of undergraduate involvement (including members of under-represented groups), which has led to many publications with undergraduate students as co-authors, as well as students successfully moving on to careers in research. The investigator is also very active in local and regional activities that promote the sciences at all levels, including demonstrations at schools, science fair involvement, and assuming leadership roles in the local American Chemical Society (ACS) section and the Science Olympiad. Such activities are necessary to ensure a vibrant local science community and to foster excitement of the upcoming generations of young scientists for science and research. <br/><br/>Active glutamate transport is a multi-step process that requires multiple ion/substrate binding steps, as well as conformational changes. Despite recent progress towards understanding the transport process through functional studies, as well as the identification of structural models of a bacterial homologue of mammalian glutamate transporters in several states, basic questions about the mechanism, specificity, and dynamics of interaction of the transporters with cations, in particular K+ and Li+, as well as the energetic contributions to energy barriers that control the transport rate and specific structural changes in the transport cycle remain unresolved. Answers to these questions are obtained by applying a combination of experimental and computational methods, allowing the investigation of the dynamics of glutamate transport in real time, with microsecond time resolution, and to test predictions from all-atom and simplified molecular models. This work has the potential to reveal new aspects of glutamate movement across the cellular membrane, in particular with respect to the cooperation of polar and non-polar forces, which are fine tuned to adjust the energy barriers associated with ion/substrate binding, as well as conformational changes. The novel insight may uncover more general concepts that are employed by membrane transport proteins, in order to provide a permeation pathway for polar molecules across the hydrophobic membrane."},{"AwardNumber":"1558889","Title":"Collaborative Research: Planning Reliable and Resilient Transportation Networks against Correlated Infrastructure Disruptions","NSFOrganization":"CMMI","Program(s)":"CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS","StartDate":"07/15/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"09/23/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Xiaopeng Li","State":"FL","Organization":"University of South Florida","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Elise D.

However, as the system size scales, the power and energy consumption of these heterogeneous multiprocessors vastly exceed the budget. The primary focus of the project is to develop energy efficient techniques that can be implemented in the GPU with proper coordination with the CPUs. Energy reduction in GPU-based heterogeneous multiprocessors can be achieved by extending current CPU techniques to GPU. The project develops new runtime techniques for GPU core scaling and Dynamic Voltage and Frequency scaling (DVFS), and combines them with basic changes in algorithms and data structures to improve energy efficiency. <br/><br/>Existing models for performance and energy consumption assume 100% utilization of the processing cores and perfect overlap with memory access during execution. This project develops a more accurate model for energy efficiency taking into account the algorithm, data structure, caching and memory coalescing for different applications. A runtime system is being developed that monitors the GPU core and memory utilizations together with the energy consumption while executing an application. The runtime adjusts the number of cores and/or frequency level dynamically through prediction, but continues to make corrections as the execution proceeds. The runtime is extended to heterogeneous systems consisting of both CPU and GPU.<br/>The current DVFS techniques for scientific computing applications cannot fully eliminate slacks, therefore, are not energy optimal. By leveraging the algorithmic characteristics, a frequency scheduling technique is developed for linear algebra applications to achieve better energy efficiency.<br/>The project optimizes the energy efficiency while partitioning and designing tasks of an application. Without loss of generality, Cholesky factorization is used as an example and an energy efficient scheduler is developed. <br/><br/>The project develops software products that can be readily applied to existing large scale heterogeneous computers executing scientific applications that are suitable for defense, energy and critical infrastructure projects. Also applications like weather forecasting and structural dynamics are developed that have a great impact on society.

Along these lines, calculus courses are a gateway to STEM majors and careers; however, the national success rate in these courses is still too low. The premise of the project is that to increase student learning and success in calculus courses, a shift in teaching practices will need to occur. While past efforts have produced a variety of best practices for teaching calculus, these practices are still not used as widely as desired. The University of Central Florida (UCF) MATH-GAINS project will create a departmental model that can be used to address this national need. First, MATH-GAINS will develop a culture in which Department of Mathematics faculty members persistently apply best practices in their teaching of calculus courses. Instructors will work in teams to learn about and practice these teaching strategies and measure student learning in their courses. The project will provide professional development, feedback, and opportunities for reflection. The process of adopting these teaching strategies will be studied to identify the factors that enable faculty at a large, research-intensive university to successfully implement such methods so that the model could be adapted by other departments and institutions. Additionally, MATH-GAINS will allow studies of best teaching practices for postsecondary calculus. A target group of 30 students will be persistently impacted over the three-semester calculus sequence, resulting in increased student understanding of the mathematics, retention and graduation rates for these students, and knowledge about the cumulative effect of evidence-based instruction for researchers and faculty. <br/><br/>The MATH-GAINS project will build on research-based change strategies, and its implementation design will use critical features identified by those theories of change to shift the culture of mathematics faculty.

Each year, learning communities consisting of faculty members and graduate teaching assistants will learn from the literature, select from a menu of evidence-based teaching practices, develop learning materials for projects involving those practices, and implement their projects during both fall and spring semesters. The Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol will be used to assess the level of implementation of evidence-based practices, prompt faculty reflection, and suggest avenues for improvement. Faculty will collect data on student learning to assess the effectiveness of their implemented practices for diverse student populations in calculus. On-going evaluation will build the knowledge base for the creation of a model for institutional change, where application of evidence based teaching practices in calculus becomes standard and perpetual faculty practice.

Biological (bacteria) and non-biological (soil particles) natural colloids are ubiquitous in groundwater. The transport of pathogens (biological colloids) is relevant to producing safe drinking water, and the transport of heavy metals as facilitated by colloids (non-biological colloids) in groundwater has been widely recognized as a serious public concern. Almost all natural colloids are anisotropic in nature, being non-spherical in shape and possessing varied degrees of heterogeneity in surface charge. This project addresses the limitations of our current understanding of transport and fate of colloidal particles in porous media that stem from approximations of spherical shape and uniform surface charge used in previous studies. An improved understanding of colloid transport and retention in the environment will provide critical knowledge needed for producing safe drinking water and protecting sustainable water resources, essential steps for human health and development. Results from this work will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate curriculums.

Systematic experiments using laboratory-prepared rod-shaped colloidal particles with various aspect ratios and surface-charge heterogeneity will be analyzed in novel ways. Applications of cutting-edge methodologies in microelectronics, high-resolution mass sensing, optical microscopy, and laser-scanning cytometry will enable observations of colloid attachment rates on the surfaces and pore throats of the mineral grains comprising porous media and reveal phenomena appropriate to scaling up observations to aquifers. In parallel, a numerical simulation model that is capable of tracking both the movement and orientation of anisotropic colloids within porous media will be developed.

The semi&#8208;conductor industry now faces the infamous power and utilization walls, that is, physical constraints such as levels of power and energy consumption, but also reliability of the various components, must be taken into account not only during the chip fabrication process, but also when generating machine code and during program execution. To meet these challenges, heterogeneity in design, both at the architecture and technology levels, will be the prevailing approach for energy efficient computing as specialized cores, accelerators, and graphical processing units (GPUs) can eliminate the energy overheads of general&#8208;purpose homogeneous cores. However, with future technological challenges pointing in the direction of on&#8208;chip heterogeneity, and because of the traditional difficulty of parallel programming, it becomes imperative to produce new system software stacks that can take advantage of the heterogeneous hardware. <br/><br/>This project proposes to rethink the whole hardware&#8208;software interface, by researching novel ways to design many&#8208;core chip architectures and weaving heterogeneous components together and binding them by a fast and energy efficient on&#8208;chip interconnection network. On top of it will lay a system software layer to efficiently drive applications and map them onto the best suited components of the chip. Both the hardware and software layer are encompassed by a novel execution model, which describes how to orchestrate the various parts of a program in the most efficient way (be it with respect to power and energy, performance, or reliability). To achieve these goals, the development of a new model of computation called SPARTA (Stream-based Processor And RunTime Architecture) is proposed. The proposed model combines a new runtime and compiler technology with a hierarchical heterogeneous many&#8208;core chip and features hardware mechanisms for stream&#8208;based fine&#8208;grain program execution models to be reflected in different new software/hardware systems. Many issues are be envisioned, including programmability, scalability, performance evaluation, and power efficiency. Specifically, the goal is to identify the major challenges and obstacles toward an efficient exploitation of parallelism and scalability. To do so, traditional approaches will be re-evaluated by studying a collection of representative programs. A vertical design methodology is then proposed to effectively address the above challenges through the SPARTA approach and its implementation. In particular, the proposed cross-layer methodology consists of (a) a programming/execution model that will combine the Codelet model (leveraging our past research in dataflow models and extensions) with generalized streams: the Streaming Codelets, (b) an architecture model that will efficiently support the Streaming Codelets in heterogeneous hardware, and (c) a system software Stack that will be capable of effectively mapping Streaming Codelets to the proposed architecture. Finally, a qualitative and quantitative study of SPARTA will be performed via selected benchmarks and a consolidated methodology based on experimentation and analysis.

Consequently, the design of low latency, high bandwidth, power-efficient and reliable Network-on-Chips (NoCs) is proving to be one of the most critical challenges to achieving the performance potential of future chips. While multicores are facilitating an enormous integration capacity, aggressive transistor scaling has also led to a steady degradation of the device and circuit reliability. Increased device wear-out (due to negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI), electro migration (EM) and hot carrier injection (HCI)) has exacerbated the waning reliability of transistors, thereby resulting in a significant increase in faults (both permanent and transient), and hardware failures. As faults manifest within the NoC substrate, multicore chips are faced with excessive delays and increased power consumption while recovering from the fault. While NoC reliability research has made significant strides at inter- and intra-router levels, there is still a lack of a holistic design approach covering the reliability of the entire NoC architecture, from device wear-out, to links and routers, to routing protocols, to applications in a cohesive manner.<br/><br/>This project will develop a holistic design methodology that addresses the reliability of the entire NoC communication infrastructure (device, links, routers, routing algorithms, and topology) while minimizing energy footprint, reducing the area overhead and only marginally impacting performance. To achieve our goal of improving link fault-recovery, this project will develop techniques to maximize the utilization of the inter-router links with minimum power and area overhead. For the router, this project will propose intra-router reliability techniques with the goals of maximizing hardware utilization, reducing redundancy and area overhead, and minimizing router pipeline latency. Further, wear-leveling techniques developed by this project will improve the reliability of NoCs and the lifetime of the chip. Finally, the proposed techniques will be evaluated by developing fault models that are injected into the NoC and evaluate the fault coverage, performance degradation and energy efficiency through extensive modeling and simulation. The holistic design methodology spanning the entire NoC architecture and the reliability techniques developed from this project will positively impact the next generation multi-core and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures with improvements in energy efficiency, performance and robustness to hard faults and soft errors.

To improve<br/>performance under a limited energy budget, systems are becoming increasingly<br/>parallel, featuring many smaller and simpler cores, and heterogeneous,<br/>featuring cores specialized for certain tasks. Even with these improvements,<br/>two critical challenges remain. First, without reducing data movement, memory<br/>accesses and communication will dominate energy consumption. Thus, limiting<br/>data movement must become a primary design objective. Second, these systems<br/>will be highly complex, and will need powerful abstractions to shield<br/>programmers from this complexity. Current systems are designed in a<br/>computation-centric way that is a poor match for these challenges.

Technology scaling down to the sub-nanometer regime has aided the growth in transistors per chip that has made multi-core architectures a power-efficient approach to harnessing parallelism and improving performance. The computing capabilities of these multi-core architectures can be unleashed only if the underlying Network-on-Chip (NoC) connecting the cores can provide the required bandwidth within the power budget of the chip. However, the design of power-efficient, low-latency and high-bandwidth NoCs using traditional metallic interconnects that can scale to 1000 cores and beyond, is proving to be a significant challenge of enormous proportions. Research has shown that emerging technologies such as photonics and wireless have the potential to alleviate the critical bandwidth, power, and latency challenges of future NoCs. However, hybrid NoC designs taking advantages of both photonics and wireless technologies have not been explored.<br/><br/>This research proposes to lay the groundwork for completely re-thinking the NoC design and proposes to explore heterogeneity of emerging interconnect technology for designing performance scalable, and power-efficient NoCs. The overall objective is to combine multiple technologies to achieve our challenging goals of (1) scalability to 1000 cores, (2) power efficiency of at least a 50% power reduction as compared to the state-of-the-art metallic interconnects, and (3) high bandwidth and low latency across a wide variety of applications. First, at the architecture level, optics will be deployed for short-range (< 100 cores) to improve local communication and wireless for long-range communication in order to scale the number of cores to 1000 by providing sufficient global bandwidth. Second, at the circuit level, hybrid transceiver architectures will be explored to integrate novel ultra-low power wireless circuits based on SiGe/BiCMOS technology with optical waveguides and ring-resonators to provide the large bandwidth desired for kilo-core designs. Furthermore, wireless communication requirements will be addressed by designing mm-wave/THz frequency broadband and directional antennas based on advanced 3D printing technology. This proposal describes a transformative and viable approach combining technology, architecture, algorithms and applications research for designing scalable and energy-efficient NoCs. The cross-cutting nature of this research will foster new research directions in several areas, spanning technology/energy-aware NoC design, novel computer architectures, and cutting-edge modeling and simulations tools for emerging technologies."},{"AwardNumber":"1636488","Title":"Kahler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds","NSFOrganization":"DMS","Program(s)":"GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS","StartDate":"09/07/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"03/09/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Chi Li","State":"IN","Organization":"Purdue University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Shuguang Wang","EndDate":"06/30/2017","AwardedAmountToDate":"$104,311.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"li2285@purdue.edu","OrganizationStreet":"Young Hall","OrganizationCity":"West Lafayette","OrganizationState":"IN","OrganizationZip":"479072114","OrganizationPhone":"7654941055","NSFDirectorate":"MPS","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1265","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Einstein manifolds are geometric objects important in both mathematics and physics. In physics, they are used to describe the space-time in Einstein's theory of general relativity. In mathematics, they are basic building blocks of more complicated geometries. The study of Einstein manifolds is thus a basic problem in geometry. One effective way to construct Einstein manifolds is to require that the underlying manifold has a complex algebraic structure. In other words, the points of such a manifold are complex-valued solutions of polynomial equations. Einstein metrics on such algebraic manifolds are called Kaehler-Einstein metrics. In the late 70s, Aubin and Yau constructed Kaehler-Einstein metrics with negative Ricci curvatures. Yau also constructed Kaehler-Einstein metrics with zero Ricci curvatures, which are now called Calabi-Yau metrics and play important roles in the string theory of physics. On the other hand, only recently has people pinned down a sufficient and necessary condition, called K-stability, for the existence of Kaehler-Einstein metrics with positive Ricci curvatures for a class of algebraic manifolds called Fano manifolds. This result depends on the work of many people, most importantly by Tian and Donaldson. After these discoveries, we want to further our understandings of such Kaehler-Einstein metrics and the obstructions to their existence. These problems are the main concerns of the proposal. The study of these Kaehler-Einstein metrics will greatly improve our understanding of Einstein manifolds important in both physics and mathematics. <br/><br/>In this proposal, the PI will study the following closely related problems. 1.Various continuity methods of partial differential equations are used to solve the Kaehler-Einstein equation. The recent breakthroughs give qualitative pictures of blow up behaviors and convergences of these continuity methods. However, deeper quantitative understandings of the blow up behaviors or singularity forming phenomena are needed. The PI has studied in detail such quantitative properties for toric Fano manifolds. The PI will study the singularities forming processes for a broader class of Fano manifolds. The PI will also study the classification of the singularities formed in low dimensions by combining the methods from Riemannian geometry and algebraic geometry. 2.The PI will study concrete constructions of Kaehler-Einstein metrics and related canonical metrics. On the one hand, the PI likes to extend the construction of toric Kaehler-Einstein metrics to other Kaehler-Einstein metrics with large symmetries, for example, on spherical varieties. On the other hand, the PI will study the classification of Sasaki-Einstein metrics with large symmetries in low dimensions based on his calculations of important examples. Related methods will also be applied to construct Kaehler-Ricci solitons and extremal Kaehler metrics. 3.The PI will study the deformations of canonical Kaehler metrics including Kaehler-Einstein metrics and Kaehler-Ricci solitons, and to understand the moduli spaces of these canonical Kaehler metrics. He will also study the singularities on the boundaries of these moduli spaces. 4.The PI and his collaborator will study the K-stability using algebraic geometry based on their previous work on K-stability. They will use tools from minimal model program to test K-stability.

To provide dynamic spectrum access, auction based spectrum trading has received considerable attention. In spectrum trading, licensed users rent their unused spectrum to unlicensed users in exchange for money. The availability of unused spectrum depends on the usage pattern of licensed users and varies over time, frequency, and spatial domain. Unlicensed users can bid for this spectrum according to their needs which again vary by time and location. Thus, the auction scenario has to deal with the dynamic user demand and dynamic spectrum supply. Existing research on spectrum trading consider either a static auction environment or at most one side of the dynamics of the auction environment. Therefore, for improving spectrum unitization, it is critical to consider an auction scenario where bidders with heterogeneous demand arrive dynamically and bid for dynamically available spectrum units.<br/><br/>This project studies a dynamic auction framework and undertakes the development of auction rules and regulations designed to achieve an efficient spectrum allocation. The study consists of four major components. (1) Developing the dynamic auction framework with dynamic arrival of users with variable lifetime and dynamic spectrum supply. (2) Tackling the design challenges associated with the diversity in demand and supply in terms of units and duration and devising a truthful auction mechanism. (3) Designing a generic auction framework to fit the auction rules and regulations and define the communication method using a secure communication protocol. (4) Developing a testbed to implement, experiment and validate the auction framework. This research will enhance radio spectrum sharing and utilization, providing more spectrum opportunities for existing and new applications. This project provides interdisciplinary research opportunities for graduate students working on the proposed research. This project incorporates research results into courses and to recruit students from underrepresented backgrounds."},{"AwardNumber":"1619816","Title":"CAREER: Combating Dark Silicon through Specialization: Communication-Aware Tiled Many-Accelerator Architectures","NSFOrganization":"CCF","Program(s)":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION","StartDate":"10/01/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"05/23/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Mark Hempstead","State":"MA","Organization":"Tufts University","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"Tao Li","EndDate":"01/31/2019","AwardedAmountToDate":"$125,080.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"mark@ece.tufts.edu","OrganizationStreet":"20 Professors Row","OrganizationCity":"Medford","OrganizationState":"MA","OrganizationZip":"021555807","OrganizationPhone":"6176273417","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"7798","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"1045, 7941","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Researchers have predicted that, in the coming years, the computer industry?s steady gains in computing performance will slow and even cease all together because of a condition known as Dark Silicon. Dark Silicon is the result of an increase in power density that will make it necessary to leave sections of a microchip powered off. The consequences of Dark Silicon could be widespread, limiting the increasing benefits all aspects of society---from medicine, commerce to entertainment----have reaped from advances in computing. One solution is specialization. With the advent of high-level synthesis tools capable of generating circuits from high-level programming languages such as C, it is now possible to realize specialized accelerators for any application with 10-100x the efficiency of general purpose microprocessors. The computing industry needs new architecture paradigms to organize thousands of these accelerators. This project envisions the computing platform of the future as comprised of domain specific tiles, each with 10-100 specialized accelerators. The research team will advance this vision with innovations in two aspects. First, by inventing a new memory-interconnect subsystem capable of keeping these specialized cores fed with data. Second, canonical tiles will be invented for different application domains that can be studied by the wider research community.<br/><br/>The team will study memory-interconnect systems for tiles in a manner that recognizes the unique features of many-accelerator architectures: intermittent usage of accelerators, bursts of communication, and the need to share memory between specialized cores. While designing tiles of many-accelerators, the team will develop a new description language that describes the computation and communication capabilities of a tile and matches them with a graph representation of the workload. To provide broader impact, the tools, canonical designs, and models developed by this project will be made available to the wider research community to enable the study and eventual commercialization of specialized architectures. As increasing the technological literacy of the general public is essential to cultivating responsible behavior, the integrated educational plan focuses on all age groups: it reaches K-12 students through workshops and presentations; undergraduate and graduate students through research opportunities and course offerings; and the greater Philadelphia community."},{"AwardNumber":"1531382","Title":"MRI: Acquisition of a Multi-Beam SEM/FIB for Multidisciplinary Materials Study and Training","NSFOrganization":"CMMI","Program(s)":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION","StartDate":"10/01/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"09/03/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Lin Li","State":"MS","Organization":"Jackson State University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Joanne D.

The Communication network, which conveys system measurements from sensors to controllers, plays a key role in CPSs, similarly to the nerve system in human beings. Traditional data communication networks (e.g., cellular networks or WiFi) focus only the delivery of data packets, while the ultimate goal of a CPS is to control the physical dynamics (e.g., stabilizing the voltages and frequencies in power networks). Hence, the traditional design of communication network may not be optimal in the context of CPSs, due to the mismatched goals of designs. This results in a pressing need to study the design of communication networks in CPSs, which helps to enhance the agility, robustness and efficiency of CPSs. This project studies how to efficiently design system-dynamics-aware communication networks for CPS, which integrates the areas of communications, networking, control, and dynamical systems, and has applications to the important and growing field of CPS in critical infrastructures.<br/><br/>The project specifically addresses the following research tasks: (a) Joint Design as Hybrid Systems: The theory of hybrid systems is used to model CPS, in which the operation mode of communication network is modeled as the discrete state of a hybrid system, while the physical dynamics are modeled using the continuous state. The communication and control sub-systems are designed jointly by optimizing the hybrid system dynamics; (b) Separate Design via Information Interface: The communication and control sub-systems are designed separately and are bridged via designated interfaces, such as communication quality of service (QoS) or virtual queue mapping; (c) Coexistence with Elastic Data Traffics: The realtime data traffic may share the same communication resource with elastic data traffics such as Internet data. The queuing dynamics of elastic data traffic and the physical dynamics of CPS are integrated in the same framework, and the scheduling for the two types of traffics (elastic and realtime) is studied; (d) Application and Implementation in Smart Grid: The principles, algorithms, and protocols obtained in the previous two tasks are applied and substantiated in smart grids as a case study for CPS. The voltage control in microgrid, both centralized and decentralized, is particularly studied. They are implemented in both software simulation testbed, in which the communication and control sub-systems are co-simulated, and hardware testbed using USRP boards and the microgrid testbed."},{"AwardNumber":"1524462","Title":"CSR: Small: Towards Energy-efficient Internet Mobile Streaming","NSFOrganization":"CNS","Program(s)":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS","StartDate":"10/01/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"08/25/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Songqing Chen","State":"VA","Organization":"George Mason University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Amy Apon","EndDate":"09/30/2018","AwardedAmountToDate":"$495,426.00","Co-PIName(s)":"Fei Li","PIEmailAddress":"sqchen@cs.gmu.edu","OrganizationStreet":"4400 UNIVERSITY DR","OrganizationCity":"FAIRFAX","OrganizationState":"VA","OrganizationZip":"220304422","OrganizationPhone":"7039932295","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"7354","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"7923","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Today more people are enjoying streaming services on their mobile devices from anywhere at anytime.

It proposes to build battery-free sensing network (BFSN) by exploiting the ambient energy to support its operation. By removing the need for battery, it will support a sustainable operation, especially in hazard conditions. The underlying novelty is the establishment of a hybrid architecture (composed of three layers: battery-free devices, battery-powered devices, and base-stations) to enable the battery-free multi-hop networking with the low-power supply, extremely limited computation and storage in battery-free devices. The proposed research has the potential to revolutionize the communication architecture for sensor and cyber-physical systems, lowering their cost and easing their management.<br/><br/>Many key challenges in realizing the benefits of BFSN will focus on the small-sized battery-free devices, such as charging these devices, placement of devices and charging stations, networking these devices and the wider network, and locating them.

A CR-capable service provider can acquire spectrum on demand from the secondary spectrum market to avoid paying the huge spectrum licensing fees, significantly lowering the threshold of entry to the wireless business. As a result, it is foreseeable that small and local secondary wireless service providers (SSPs) will flourish, transforming the wireless business from one dictated by few giant carriers to a much more competitive marketplace. Existing secondary spectrum market models mainly consider a market comprised by big SSPs, where every SSP is assumed to have sufficient secondary radio resource and coverage to independently service end users. In practice, however, these models inevitably exclude the large number of small and local SSPs that do not have enough resource and coverage to independently satisfy the demand of end users (e.g., for high-rate access or long-range routing) from the market, leading to reduced market competitiveness, and henceforth compromised market efficiency. This project will investigate a novel competition-and-collaboration spectrum market framework, whereby small and local SSPs will collaborate in providing service to retain more market shares, better profitability, stronger market competitiveness, and higher market efficiency. This project, if successful, will significantly advance our understanding on the network economics of the secondary spectrum ecosystem comprised by primary spectrum sellers, SSPs, end users, and human, and will contribute to the real-world deployment of economically feasible and sustainable spectrum market.<br/><br/>The proposed research will follow three thrusts. (1) For short-term services, assuming perfect rationality for every player in the market, the secondary spectrum market is first modeled as a spot market. A truthful procurement auction model is proposed to study the optimal market mechanisms and their strategy proofness under a variety of market conditions. (2) For long-term services, the project will study the potential and implication of the futures market, in which service predictability in the time domain is exploited to improve market efficiency, using methods such as option pricing and hedging. (3) The rational-player assumption is released and the project will study the impact of irrationality and human factors on market efficiency using methods from Behavioral Economics. This project will also carry out a comprehensive educational plan to broaden its impact, including integrating research with undergraduate and graduate education, recruiting and outreaching to minority and under-represented students, and efficient dissemination and outreaching to the general public."}],"Artificial Intelligence":"3","Programming Language":"3","System":"3","Theory":"3"},{"rank":"40","univ":"University of Utah","name":"Feifei Li","acm_fellow":"0","ieee_fellow":"0","funding":"1","fundingDetails": [{"AwardNumber":"1565207","Title":"SusChEM: Powerful and Tunable Electron Donors for Reduction Chemistry and Catalysis","NSFOrganization":"CHE","Program(s)":"Chem Struct,Dynmcs&Mechansms B","StartDate":"09/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"04/04/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Dennis Lichtenberger","State":"AZ","Organization":"University of Arizona","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Tingyu Li","EndDate":"08/31/2019","AwardedAmountToDate":"$529,238.00","Co-PIName(s)":"Dennis Evans, Jon Njardarson","PIEmailAddress":"dlichten@u.arizona.edu","OrganizationStreet":"888 N Euclid Ave","OrganizationCity":"Tucson","OrganizationState":"AZ","OrganizationZip":"857194824","OrganizationPhone":"5206266000","NSFDirectorate":"MPS","ProgramElementCode(s)":"9102","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"8037, 8060, 8248, 8396, 8397, 8650","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Dennis L.

Imposing constraints in the percolation model usually makes the model lose stochastic monotonicity, which, in the unconstrained case, is critical to study the phase transition described by the behavior of infinite clusters. One goal of the project is to develop new combinatorial and probabilistic techniques to study the behavior of infinite clusters without using stochastic monotonicity. Enumerating self-avoiding walks is typically difficult due to the non-Markovian structure.

The recent explosion of ""big data"" has raised several critical challenges in detecting cross-sample variation, which render existing methods inadequate and entail an urgent need for new methodologies. The most notable and prevalent challenges include complex distributional structures, the highly local nature of variation, various extraneous sources of variation, data sparsity, and massive computational demand. The overarching aim of this research project is to develop a general framework including theory, methods, algorithms, and software for effectively identifying variation in modern big data sets to address these challenges. <br/><br/>Specific inference problems to be addressed in this research project include: (i) identifying differences, especially highly local variations, across multiple data sets; (ii) separating intrinsic (i.e., scientifically interesting) cross-sample variation from extraneous variation; (iii) decomposing cross-sample variation into contributions from multiple sources; and (iv) identifying cross-sample variation and variance components in general random objects, including a variety of processes and functional observations. The use of multi-scale inference and Bayesian nonparametric modeling has led to development of a general probabilistic model-based framework for detecting cross-sample variation that integrates two powerful inference tactics -- multi-resolution scanning and graphical modeling. Multi-resolution scanning is the strategy of scanning through the sample space using windows of various sizes, carrying out testing or estimation for the structure of interest -- the cross-sample variation -- on each window. A class of graphical models is then designed to incorporate various dependency structures across scanning windows and data samples, thereby allowing borrowing strength among windows and related samples to achieve high statistical efficiency in identifying cross-sample variation.

This necessitates many-core chips to be designed with the ability to power down on-chip resources to effectively provide scalable performance while keeping power and energy consumption proportional to computing load. This necessity leads to considerable portions of many-core chips having to go dark, thus ushering in the era of dark silicon. To facilitate dark silicon computing, not only computational resources (i.e., processor cores) but also communication resources (i.e., networks on chips, or NoCs) used to connect the computational resources must be developed that can be powered up or down proportionally with performance scalability in response to prevailing load.<br/><br/>This research investigates new opportunities, significant challenges, and innovative solutions for harnessing dark silicon in NoC architectures that meet performance, power and energy requirements in the dark silicon era. The objective is to enable non-essential NoC routers to be powered down when needed as well as to enable a corresponding maximum number of routers and router components to be powered down for a given reduction in the number of powered-up processor cores in order to provide energy-proportional, low-power, on-chip communication. Among some of the specific lines of research that are explored are alternative topologies and coordinated routing algorithms to enable more efficient power-gating of NoC routers, holistic approaches for exploiting coordination between the NoC and other on-chip system components as well as factoring in key application characteristics, and novel packet-oriented dynamic power control schemes that explore energy-saving opportunities beyond the conventionally targeted low-load traffic region.

Today the interest in AM continues to grow. Although reducing environmental impact is considered among the main advantages, very limited efforts have been made to rigorously evaluate the environmental performance of AM processes using the well-accepted life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology; also, even less studies are oriented toward process improvement. The overarching goal of this research is to advance understanding on how product design affects energy/material consumption and air emissions of representative AM processes. If successful, this research will bridge geometry and life cycle inventory (LCI), which provides much needed data foundation for LCA of AM processes and furthermore, enables the exploration of opportunities to re-design AM process and equipment for smaller environmental impacts. The research will be undertaken by a team consisting of experts in life cycle assessment, additive manufacturing, manufacturing process modeling, and pollution prevention at the Purdue University and the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). <br/><br/>Four research tasks will be jointly pursued: (1) Material flow modeling and feedstock chemical composition analysis, (2) Energy consumption modeling, (3) Air emission characterization and quantification, and (4) AM process and equipment redesign for improved environmental performance. The research findings will be verified in both laboratory and industrial settings. The research is an effort to systematically evaluate the environmental impacts of the emerging AM processes using LCA methodology, with particular focus on unit process level LCI. The project will advance understanding of the material/energy flow and air emissions associated with four representative AM processes. The proposed LCI model is capable of predicting inventory flows of environmental significance while requiring only minimal experimental efforts. The research is an effort to bridge geometry and LCI of AM processes, which can guide the design and development of AM equipment and processes for enhanced environmental sustainability. Deeper understanding on energy consumption, feedstock material composition, and occupation hazard risk due to particulate matters and volatile organic compounds can provide guidelines for designers, manufacturers, and government agencies to safeguard workforce and reduce environmental footprints of AM processes. This will in turn accelerate the larger scale technology adoption of AM, and offer a competitive edge regarding sustainability to the U.S. manufacturing sector in the global market. Research results will be broadly disseminated through journal papers, conference presentations, online demonstrations, and industrial collaboration. The educational activities will strengthen the awareness of advanced life cycle analysis on additive manufacturing in engineering and environmental fields.

A doughnut and the spatial universe are both examples of three-manifolds. These objects arise naturally in many contexts in physical and other natural sciences and model many interesting phenomena. A geometric way of studying them is to cut a complicated three-manifold into simpler three-dimensional pieces along two-dimensional surfaces. For example, a so-called Heegaard splitting is such a decomposition. One can also use a technique known as surgery on a three-manifold that replaces a geometric piece with a different one. In this project, the PI plans to study various questions on three-manifolds using Heegaard splitting and surgery. The research targets several central questions in low-dimensional topology and knot theory, which has potential impact on other areas of scientific investigations, such as the topological structures of DNA.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI plans to study topology of three-manifolds. The first part of the research is to study a long-standing conjecture concerning Heegaard genus and degree-one map. The conjecture can be translated into a study of how Heegaard genus changes under a special type of surgeries and the PI plans to study such surgeries. The PI also plans to study several related questions on Heegaard genus of certain amalgamated three-manifolds. The second part of the project is to explore a new approach to proving the Berge Conjecture. This approach is inspired by the PI's observation that if there is a certain intersection pattern, then one can perform a stabilization and then an unstabilization, changing a Heegaard splitting of a knot exterior (in a lens space) into a meridionally primitive splitting. The PI plans to develop new tools and use techniques from his previous work to achieve these goals."},{"AwardNumber":"1617713","Title":"AF: Small: Randomness in Computation - Old Problems and New Directions","NSFOrganization":"CCF","Program(s)":"ALGORITHMIC FOUNDATIONS","StartDate":"07/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"05/25/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Xin Li","State":"MD","Organization":"Johns Hopkins University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Rahul Shah","EndDate":"06/30/2019","AwardedAmountToDate":"$374,815.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"lixints@cs.jhu.edu","OrganizationStreet":"3400 N CHARLES ST","OrganizationCity":"Baltimore","OrganizationState":"MD","OrganizationZip":"212182608","OrganizationPhone":"4105168668","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"7796","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"7923, 7927","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"A major goal of computer science is to study how to compute more efficiently using limited resources. The understanding of this question has had profound influence on our daily life, in a variety of areas ranging from e-commerce, cloud computing, to travel planning and weather forecast. In this project the PI seeks to understand how to efficiently use the valuable resource of randomness (such as coin flips) in computation.<br/><br/>Randomness is extremely useful in computation and widely used in practice. Simulation of complex models such as those used for weather forecast and economy prediction relies on the use of random processes, and modern computer security will be lost completely without randomness. In this context, the project studies the fundamental questions of the power and limitations of randomness in computation. From a theoretical aspect, it can lead to breakthroughs towards solving long standing open questions in computer science, such as whether randomness is really necessary for algorithms. From a practical aspect, it can lead to improvements in several areas important to society, such as designing streaming and scalable computation protocols for massive datasets, enhancing computer security in an adversarial environment, and tolerating errors in communication protocols. Based on the research activities, the educational component in this project plans to train several Ph.D. students, publish online surveys for free access, integrate research outcomes into courses the PI is or will be teaching, and provide research opportunities for minority students through a joint effort with Johns Hopkins University.<br/><br/>The questions that will be addressed in this project include how to generate high quality randomness for computation, how to use randomness in the presence of information leakage or tampering by an adversary, and how to use randomness to detect and correct errors introduced in communications. Two fundamental objects and tools for studying these questions are pseudorandom generators and randomness extractors. A pseudorandom generator is an algorithm that stretches a small number of random bits into a large number of bits that appear to be perfectly random to a certain class of functions. A randomness extractor is an algorithm that converts low quality random sources into very high quality random bits. The project will explore new ways of constructing these objects, as well as the connections between these objects and other areas in computer science, such as cryptography, error correcting codes, and computational complexity. Through this the PI seeks to establish new connections between different areas, and thus leading to possible new breakthroughs."},{"AwardNumber":"1564348","Title":"TWC: Medium: Collaborative: Online Social Network Fraud and Attack Research and Identification","NSFOrganization":"CNS","Program(s)":"Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace","StartDate":"07/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"03/28/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Jun Li","State":"OR","Organization":"University of Oregon Eugene","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Christopher Clifton","EndDate":"06/30/2020","AwardedAmountToDate":"$507,052.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"lijun@cs.uoregon.edu","OrganizationStreet":"5219 UNIVERSITY OF OREGON","OrganizationCity":"Eugene","OrganizationState":"OR","OrganizationZip":"974035219","OrganizationPhone":"5413465131","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"8060","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"7434, 7924","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Online social networks (OSNs) face various forms of fraud and attacks, such as spam, denial of service, Sybil attacks, and viral marketing. In order to build trustworthy and secure OSNs, it has become critical to develop techniques to analyze and detect OSN fraud and attacks. Existing OSN security approaches usually target a specific type of OSN fraud or attack and often fall short of detecting more complex attacks such as collusive attacks that involve many fraudulent OSN accounts, or dynamic attacks that encompass multiple attack phases over time. This research, dubbed oSAFARI (Online SociAl network Fraud and Attack Research and Identification), models, analyzes and characterizes OSN frauds and attacks; designs, develops, and evaluates a new approach to detecting static OSN frauds and attacks; and further enhances the approach to handle dynamic attacks with multiple phases. The research team plans to develop a new course focused on OSN attacks and defenses, which has the potential to be offered across many institutions. To increase public security awareness, the team also plans to develop tutorial courses on typical OSN attacks and their defense and offer them at popular public events and in freshman classes. The research team will broadly disseminate their results, tools, software, and documents to the research community, IT industries, and to OSN companies.<br/><br/>This project embraces a systematic, comprehensive study of OSN frauds and attacks. It models OSN threats by viewing an OSN as a graph embedded with attacker nodes and edges, identifies and analyzes specific forms of frauds and attacks, and evaluates state-of-the-art attack analysis and defense approaches. It develops a spectral-analysis-based framework for OSN fraud and attack detection. The framework transforms topological information of an OSN graph into patterns formed by spectral coordinates in the spectral space, and introduces the use of the spectral graph perturbation theory to more easily model and capture changes of spectral coordinates for attacker, victim, and regular nodes. Further, this research develops spectral-analysis-based detection approaches for complex networks where nodes can carry attributes and edges can be negative, weighted, or asymmetric. Through a novel combination of the network dynamics and the vector autoregressive model, it develops an automatic spectral-analysis-based approach to detecting dynamic attacks while avoiding the high cost and low accuracy of traditional approaches. It also transforms attack characteristics from high-dimensional spectral spaces into distinctive visual patterns, and develops interactive mechanisms for analysts to incorporate domain knowledge and flexibly handle attacks. The research team will build a simulation framework to evaluate the detection approaches against different types of OSN attacks, where one can plug in different OSN datasets to evaluate and compare different detection approaches. Moreover, the research team will build a prototype oSAFARI on top of an OSN, and evaluate how oSAFARI can withstand various attacks in a real setting."},{"AwardNumber":"1611680","Title":"Topology of Symplectic 4-Manifolds","NSFOrganization":"DMS","Program(s)":"TOPOLOGY","StartDate":"07/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"05/23/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Tian-Jun Li","State":"MN","Organization":"University of Minnesota-Twin Cities","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Swatee Naik","EndDate":"06/30/2019","AwardedAmountToDate":"$267,029.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"TJLI@MATH.UMN.EDU","OrganizationStreet":"200 OAK ST SE","OrganizationCity":"Minneapolis","OrganizationState":"MN","OrganizationZip":"554552070","OrganizationPhone":"6126245599","NSFDirectorate":"MPS","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1267","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"This research project investigates the properties of symplectic manifolds.

This necessitates many-core chips to be designed with the ability to power down on-chip resources to effectively provide scalable performance while keeping power and energy consumption proportional to computing load. This necessity leads to considerable portions of many-core chips having to go dark, thus ushering in the era of dark silicon. To facilitate dark silicon computing, not only computational resources (i.e., processor cores) but also communication resources (i.e., networks on chips, or NoCs) used to connect the computational resources must be developed that can be powered up or down proportionally with performance scalability in response to prevailing load.<br/><br/>This research investigates new opportunities, significant challenges, and innovative solutions for harnessing dark silicon in NoC architectures that meet performance, power and energy requirements in the dark silicon era. The objective is to enable non-essential NoC routers to be powered down when needed as well as to enable a corresponding maximum number of routers and router components to be powered down for a given reduction in the number of powered-up processor cores in order to provide energy-proportional, low-power, on-chip communication.

Ions are charged atomic or molecular species that can dissolve in solvents like water or organic liquids. Ions are important in a very broad range of natural and technological systems. Table salt is the most common everyday example, but ions of many kinds figure prominently in electrochemistry, colloids, surface chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, soaps and detergents, biological membrane ion channels, geology, and energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors). Not all ions are the same; in fact, the ion identity (through its size, shape, and chemistry) can dramatically affect the properties of a given system. The focus of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of what causes such large differences between ionic species. This research aids in developing more accurate models for how the ions interact with solvents such as water or organic liquids (such as ethylene carbonate, the solvent in the lithium (Li)-ion batteries used in every electronic device). Towards this end, Beck and his coworkers employ accurate models that come from the fundamental theory of nature, quantum mechanics. Their goal is to learn about basic aspects of ion solvation and then produce reliable models that can help understand problems like atmospheric chemistry and the development of longer-lasting batteries. The educational component of this project centers on continued development of a course on sustainable energy. Professor Beck is currently the chair of the State Users Group at the Ohio Supercomputer Center, with over 1000 active computational science users. <br/><br/><br/>This project addresses fundamental aspects of ion solvation in water and organic solvents. Ion solvation figures prominently in surface chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, soaps and detergents, biological membrane ion channels, geology, and energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors). Beck and his coworkers aim to establish a fundamental energy scale for single-ion solvation. This allows for a firmer groundwork for studying specific ion effects. The research also leads to the development of better classical models that can be applied to much larger systems such as sea salt aerosols and improved batteries. The behavior of ions near interfaces is an essential aspect of all of these problems. The research has four objectives: to study ions in water, in organic solvents, and in biological channels, and to further develop a new stochastic algorithm for quantum simulations on parallel computers. The study of ions in water leads to the accurate prediction of the effective surface potential of water, a long sought quantity in condensed phase chemistry. This work employs ab initio quantum simulations and quasi-chemical theory to obtain quantitative estimates of the bulk and real hydration free energies. The study of ions in organic solvents applies the same ideas to ions in ethylene carbonate, a key electrolyte in Li-ion batteries. That research improves current models for these systems. The study of ions in biological channels examines the interaction of protons and chloride ions in the bacterial CLC channel protein. The development of stochastic algorithims may lead to a new forward-looking algorithm for large-scale quantum simulations. The method employs stochastic differential equations to solve for the one-particle density matrix.

Conventional DRAM-based memory is facing severe technology scaling limitations such as process variations, which hinders the growth in memory density at reasonable cost. Such challenges inspire the search for alternative memory technologies such as the emerging non-volatile Resistive RAMs (ReRAM). ReRAM exploits resistance of Metal-Oxide-Metal structure to represent stored information. It has shorter read and write latency, and better write endurance when compared with other non-volatile memories. ReRAM exhibits superior scalability and can be architected to build high-density memories using a crossbar structure, or 3D stacking. Such features make ReRAM a competitive technology as a DRAM replacement to achieve significant large memory capacity for modern data intensive applications. Education objectives will be achieved through broad dissemination of results via publications, research seminars, tutorials, software demonstrations, conference participation, and technology transfer initiatives. Continuous student training will be carried through involving graduate, undergraduate students, especially underrepresented students in this research. <br/><br/>There are major difficulties in building a large memory using the crossbar ReRAM architecture.

Alpha-synuclein forms two types of aggregates: mature fibrils and oligomers. The mature fibrils are known to be non-toxic, but oligomers can cause the death of the neuronal cells by forming pore structure in the cell membrane. Understanding the structure of oligomer aggregates should provide clues for the development of therapeutic agents for Parkinson's disease.

In addition, a new laboratory experiment on peptide synthesis for a graduate level organic chemistry class is being developed. <br/><br/>Various techniques have been developed to determine the structure of proteins. Among them, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provides a fast response and has been used to evaluate various conformations (such as alpha-helix, beta-sheet, unstructured conformation) in proteins and peptides. This method utilizes the amide I band, which arises from the stretching mode of the carbonyl group in the backbone amide bonds. Traditional FTIR can only provide information about an overall fraction of the conformations. To expand its capability, 13C labels can be introduced to the carbonyls in the backbone amide bonds and a new band (the 13C amide I band) can be generated to determine the conformation of specific residues. In this project, 13C labels are introduced into the sequence of alpha-synuclein to study the conformation of the oligomers of alpha-synuclein at the residue level. In addition, Infrared Reflection-Absorption Spectroscopy is used to address the orientation of 13C labeled carbonyls. With both conformation and orientation information, the structure of alpha-synuclein can be evaluated in phospholipid bilayer structures."},{"AwardNumber":"1560020","Title":"REU Site: Enhancing Undergraduate Research Experiences in Mobile Cloud Security","NSFOrganization":"CNS","Program(s)":"RSCH EXPER FOR UNDERGRAD SITES, RES EXP FOR TEACHERS(RET)-SITE, Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace","StartDate":"06/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"02/24/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Feng Li","State":"IN","Organization":"Indiana University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Harriet G.

However, these batteries suffer from safety issues originating from the flammable liquid electrolyte that is used to transport lithium ions within the battery. One of the most promising candidates for a safer, replacement electrolyte is the ceramic lithium lanthanum zirconate (LLZO), which has good thermal/chemical stability and ionic transport properties. Nonetheless, there is still much fundamental research needed in order to improve understanding of several critical issues in LLZO and how to improve its performance. This project investigates novel LLZO nanowire structures and composites with unique nanoscale properties that can improve their conductivity for lithium ions and integration into safer, all-solid-state batteries. This project also supports education and outreach activities that focus on improving the pipeline and retention of female students in science and engineering through hands-on experiences that will increase understanding and retention of engineering concepts and stimulate the students' interests in research. Outreach to local middle school girls through a battery-related challenge to provide context on issues related to electric cars and research opportunities to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students are example activities. Educational efforts include international exchange of teaching methodologies with faculty in South Korea to understand strategies that promote female student achievement, as well as how to best engage students from diverse backgrounds in student-centered learning environments.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This research project aims to correlate composition, grain boundary structure, and crystal phase with ionic conductivity in LLZO nanowire materials prepared using electrospinning. Nanowire solid electrolytes can offer characteristics that are beneficial and advantageous compared to bulk materials - namely milder calcination conditions for crystallization, stabilization of metastable phases, and opportunities for unique structures such as core-shell composites. These characteristics can lead to properties that improve the ionic conductivity, sintering ability, and integration of the electrolytes into all-solid-state batteries. The nanowires are used to understand the LLZO phase stability, crystallization, and sintering processes. Core-shell nanowire structures are used to investigate interfacial properties and transport in composites to understand how to maximize highly conducting pathways for lithium ions and uniformly modify grain boundaries. Additionally, detailed in situ and aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy is used to understand processes such as crystallization of electrospun nanowires, impurity segregation to grain boundaries, sintering in networks of nanowires, and interdiffusion at the electrolyte/cathode interface. This information is being correlated with ionic conductivity and electrochemical cycling tests on the nanowire solid electrolyte materials and compared to bulk materials. The insights gained from this work are enabling better control of composition, stabilization of metastable phases, sintering processes, and Li ion transport, which can ultimately lead to higher ionic conductivity ceramic electrolytes."},{"AwardNumber":"1610109","Title":"Tailoring Size and Shape of beta-Sheet Nanocrystals for Crosslinking and Reinforcement of Elastomers","NSFOrganization":"DMR","Program(s)":"POLYMERS","StartDate":"06/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"03/25/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Li Jia","State":"OH","Organization":"University of Akron","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"Andrew J.

Their applications range from daily goods (for example tires) to defense (for example sonar domes of navy ships) and to biomedicine (for example coatings of artery stents). This NSF-supported research/educational team led by a chemist (Jia) and a physicist/chemical engineer (Foster) combines inspirations from biological systems and lessons from chemical and physical principles to develop the next generation of elastomers. A central focus is to reduce the size of hard particles that strengthen the elastomers to the nanometer scale. The research team will advance our fundamental understanding of how these reinforcing elements produce elastomers that are strong, stiff, and extensible and that have programmed capability to dissipate energy. This scientific knowledge can be used for a number of applications, e.g. tires that are safe, durable, and fuel-efficient. The elastomers developed can also potentially be directly applied to make medical devices safer. Parallel to the research effort, the program will train undergraduate and graduate students in this interdisciplinary area. The team will carry out outreach activities aimed at attracting domestic talent to careers in science and technology and particularly in polymer-related areas using aspects of elastomers as the primary content materials.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY. <br/><br/>The ability to manipulate atoms and molecules to form hierarchical structures with precisely controlled size and shape is central to nanoscience. Beta-sheet nanocrystals exist in both natural and synthetic elastomers and function as crosslinks and provide reinforcement. However, their morphologies are drastically different in these two circumstances. In natural elastomers (i.e., silks), they are particulates with all three dimensions smaller than 10 nm. In synthetic elastomers (e.g., polyurethanes), they have been found to be fibrous with the longest dimension, in the hydrogen-bonding direction, ranging from hundreds of nanometers to microns. In silks, the size control is attributed to specific amino acid sequences and an exquisite reeling process. Controlling the size and aspect ratio of beta-sheet nanocrystals is an unresolved challenge for synthetic systems. This research pursues this central quest of nanoscience in an important area of soft materials, elastomers, to realize material properties otherwise unattainable. The scientific approach of the research is multifaceted, involving synthesis, characterization, and mechanical studies across the molecular, supramolecular, and nanometer scales. Based on their recent success in reducing the longest dimension of n-beta-sheet nanocrystals in a series of oligo(beta-alanine)-grafted polyisobutylenes to well below 100 nm, the research team will expand their ability to regulate the size and aspect ratio of the beta-sheet nanocrystals without an elaborate aminoacid sequence and to elucidate the reinforcing characteristics of the two morphologically contrasting beta-sheet nanocrystals. The polymer brush at the interface of the nanocrystal will be another focus as it is critical for the morphological control and likely plays an important role in reinforcement as well. The specific objectives of the planned research are to: (1) synthesize monodisperse oligo(beta-alanine)-grafted polyisobutylenes that form particulate nanocrystals with still smaller aspect ratios as well as those that form fibrous nanocrystals. (2) characterize the structures and morphologies of the beta-sheet nanocrystals including the polymer brush attached to the nanocrystal surface. (3) elucidate the reinforcing characteristics and study the reinforcing mechanisms of the particulate and fibrous nanocrystals."},{"AwardNumber":"1554468","Title":"CAREER: Mechanics of a New Family of Auxetic Chiral Composites","NSFOrganization":"CMMI","Program(s)":"CAREER: FACULTY EARLY CAR DEV, Mechanics of Materials and Str","StartDate":"06/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"01/06/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Yaning Li","State":"NH","Organization":"University of New Hampshire","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Kara Peters","EndDate":"05/31/2021","AwardedAmountToDate":"$500,000.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"yaning.li@unh.edu","OrganizationStreet":"51 COLLEGE RD SERVICE BLDG 107","OrganizationCity":"Durham","OrganizationState":"NH","OrganizationZip":"038243585","OrganizationPhone":"6038622172","NSFDirectorate":"ENG","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1045, 1630","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"022E, 024E, 027E, 1045, 1630, 9102, 9150","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will investigate the mechanical behavior of a new family of auxetic chiral composites which have unique deformation mechanisms and can preserve auxetic effects under large deformations.

The southern U.S. near the Gulf Coast and the eastern U.S. bordering the Atlantic experienced two cycles of super-continent formation and break-up. These episodes of collision and rifting altered the crust and mantle lithosphere of the North American plate, thickening these layers in some regions, thinning them in others, and producing distinctive structures by aligning mineral grains and melting small amounts of rock. In this project we will use earthquake waves to construct three-dimensional models of the crust and mantle lithosphere, and we will interpret these models to better understand how continental collision and rifting affect continental lithosphere.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to improve resolution of crust and mantle structure in the southern and eastern U.S. in order to better understand lithospheric evolution and modification through the last Wilson cycle. The southern and eastern margins of the North America continent experienced two complete Wilson cycles of orogeny and rifting, leaving varied signatures of deformation and magmatism in the crust and mantle lithosphere of these regions. However, many aspects of crust and mantle structure remain poorly known at the scales relevant to distinguishing the effects of orogeny, rifting, and other processes such as hotspot interaction. Using data from the NSF EarthScope USArray/Transportable Array (TA), now completed in the contiguous U.S., we propose to image crust and mantle seismic structure in new detail. We will focus on two regions: one spanning the southern craton edge, the entire Ouachita orogeny and the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain, and the other containing the eastern craton edge, the central and northern Appalachians, and the Atlantic coast. We will use seismic data from TA stations, supplemented by other temporary and permanent broadband stations, to image crustal and mantle discontinuities using Sp and Ps receiver functions, construct 3-D anisotropic models based on Rayleigh wave, Love wave and shear-wave-splitting analyses, and we will integrate these data and methods through joint analyses and inversions. The seismic models will be used constrain the style and geometry of deformation in the crust and mantle lithosphere due to the last episodes of orogeny and rifting. This interpretation will be guided by geological and active source indicators of deformation in the shallow crust and by the type and age of magmatism across the region, bearing in mind that some facets of crust and mantle structure may reflect events that predated or followed the last cycle of orogeny and continental rifting. Variations in the impact of orogeny and rifting on the lithosphere will be compared between and within the study regions. The proposed project will support the education and career development of graduate students at the University of Houston and at Brown. It will also contribute to undergraduate senior theses, lab exercises and group research projects in undergraduate and graduate courses, and to science outreach activities with local public schools.

As observers on the outer skin of the Earth, even after four and a half billion years, we see constant reminders of this evolution in the form of earthquakes and volcanoes. Even the distinction between ocean and continent owes its origin to this dynamic process. This study is focused on the enabler of this process - the plastic nature of what we consider hard rocks. Over long times at elevated pressure and temperature, rocks behave as liquids. In recent years, tools have evolved that allow us to measure the viscous character of these hard objects at pressures and temperatures that one finds deep in the Earth. These experiments are built around a synchrotron facility that has been built at a national lab. The investigators will use both the National Synchrotron Light Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. This study will help our understanding of this dynamic evolution of the Earth. A graduate student will be supported and will participate in this research.<br/><br/>MgSiO3 in the perovskite crystal structure (bridgmanite) is the most abundant mineral in the Earth and it's calcium counterpart (CaSiO3) is among the five most abundant minerals. The plastic nature of these minerals defines the fluid character of the deep Earth. These properties are both pressure and temperature dependent, and as of yet, unknown. Knowledge of these properties along with proposed temperature models can help constrain dynamics of the Earth evolution and current state. The plastic properties of these minerals is particularly interesting because these minerals are composed of silicon in six coordination with oxygen, while the bulk of materials studied to date have silicon in four coordination with oxygen. The investigating team proposes to study the mechanical properties of these minerals at conditions of pressure and temperature appropriate to the deep Earth. They will focus on defining a quantitative flow law that expresses the plastic properties of these materials. The plasticity of lower mantle minerals at lower mantle conditions of pressure and temperature has been beyond the experimental reach. This has left us with little mineral-based knowledge of the effective viscosity of the lower mantle at the conditions of the anticipated geotherm. Development of new deformation equipment enables a new effort to characterize the quantitative flow law of the high pressure phases at the extremes of pressure and temperature of the top of the lower mantle. This proposal is to study both the Mg and the Ca end-member silicate perovskite at these conditions. This is made possible by a new facility being installed at the new synchrotron, NSLS II, at the Brookhaven National Laboratories. The new facility will provide world class synchrotron X-ray light for these experiments with a new DT25 guideblock in a 1000 ton hydraulic press with deformation capabilities.

In these plasmas, collisions between charged particles are rare. As a result, plasma waves are a major means of transferring energy from one charged particle population to another. Charged particles ""surf"" the waves. To first order, those that are moving slightly faster than the waves are energized, while those moving slower lose energy to the waves causing them to grow. There are a wide variety of plasma waves with different properties and different source mechanisms. Three of these (plasmaspheric hiss, chorus, and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves) are widely believed to play significant roles in the depletion of the electron radiation belts but how this happens and how each contributes with local time and radial distance are still-open and strongly debated questions of fundamental importance. During their interactions with the waves, electrons are scattered out of their trapped orbits and sent on trajectories into the dense atmosphere where they are lost through collisions. The work will independently examine experimental observations and, most importantly, use theoretical tools to understand the interactions leading to the precipitation. The science questions to be addressed in this proposal are particularly important, since electron precipitation leads to chemical changes in the upper atmosphere, and is critical in regulating ring current and radiation belt electron dynamics. The grant will support the further training and development of a promising female early-career scientist. The results will be useful to the broader space physics and upper atmosphere communities, to researchers studying the chemistry of the middle atmosphere, and for space environment applications, such as active mitigation techniques for both natural and artificial radiation in space.<br/><br/>Testing theoretical ideas about particular wave-particle interactions and the variations in the space environment that effect them has been difficult because the waves are measured at large radial distances in the magnetosphere while the electron precipitation that they produce must be viewed from low-earth orbit. To complicate matters, the mix of plasma waves depends on the radial distance and magnetic local time but in addition is an as yet to be determined function of the severity of space weather storming, and the phase of the storm. The principal investigator (PI) has developed an innovative technique to analyze the physical relationship between wave intensity and wave-driven electron pitch angle scattering loss, which can be directly implemented using conjugate observations from near-equatorial and low-altitude satellites. This project, which uses both theory and observation, will provide a definitive understanding of the quantitative contribution of each type of plasma wave to electron precipitation within various energy ranges and in different L-MLT regions. The results will provide a highly important contribution to our wider understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the hazardous radiation environment surrounding the Earth."},{"AwardNumber":"1555035","Title":"CAREER: Quantum Spin-Optomechanics of Optically Levitated Nanodiamonds","NSFOrganization":"PHY","Program(s)":"AMO Experiment/Atomic, Molecul","StartDate":"05/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"03/29/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Tongcang Li","State":"IN","Organization":"Purdue University","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"John Gillaspy","EndDate":"04/30/2021","AwardedAmountToDate":"$96,789.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"tcli@purdue.edu","OrganizationStreet":"Young Hall","OrganizationCity":"West Lafayette","OrganizationState":"IN","OrganizationZip":"479072114","OrganizationPhone":"7654941055","NSFDirectorate":"MPS","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1241","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"1045, 7237, 8990","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Very small particles can behave in ways that are contrary to common sense. For example, an electron (one of the particles that make up atoms) can be at multiple locations at the same time and can tunnel through a barrier--something forbidden by the classical laws of physics. The theory that explains these counterintuitive behaviors of small particles is ""quantum mechanics"". This CAREER project will investigate the possibility of making quantum mechanics appear manifest in larger, more macroscopic, systems. In specific, the project will investigate how to couple the spin of an electron to the motion of a nanoparticle (containing millions of atoms). The nanoparticle will be levitated by a laser beam in vacuum to avoid perturbations from the environment. This system should serve as a very sensitive force detector with many applications. It may enable other experiments to study the conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics, a longstanding problem in physics. The research will be integrated with several related educational activities, including direct training of graduate and undergraduate students participating in the research, and conducting inquiry workshops about infrared light for middle and high school teachers and students. Infrared light is not visible to human eyes, but plays a crucial role in global warming and fiber-optic communication. In the present work, infrared light will be used to levitate nanoparticles in vacuum. After doing hands-on experiments with infrared light in the workshop, teachers will be able to take their apparatus for use in their classrooms.<br/><br/>In more technical detail, this research project will develop a system that combines the advantages of both trapped atoms and conventional optomechanical systems for studying macroscopic quantum mechanics: an optically levitated nanodiamond with a built-in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. In some ways, this system can be considered to be an ""artificial atom"" with a very large mass. The electron spin of the NV center can be coupled to the motion of the nanodiamond with a magnetic field gradient. This coupling can be used to create large quantum spatial superposition states of the nanodiamond, which will lead to the development of a nanoparticle matter-wave interferometer for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics in unexplored parameter regimes. The main focus of this CAREER project will be to experimentally study the coupling between an NV electron spin and both the center-of-mass motion and the rotation of an optically levitated nanodiamond.

The research will also benefit the Internet of Things, the healthcare, and the consumer electronics industry, because many applications need robust and high capacity batteries. In addition, this project will help train US workforce in the interdisciplinary areas of energy, advanced materials, and advanced manufacturing through the development of interdisciplinary curricula and various science activities for diverse youth. <br/><br/>This research focuses on making 3D electrodes using an aerosol jet-based additive manufacturing method along with nanoparticle sintering. The first research objective is to establish relationships between process parameters and the quality of 3D electrode architecture produced by the processes. Process parameters of aerosol jet-based additive manufacturing include carrier gas pressure, and nanoparticle size and dispersion; and sintering process parameters include sintering energy and time. The quality of 3D electrode architecture will be measured in terms of porosity level, pore geometry, specific capacity, and resistance to capacity fade. This objective will be achieved by carrying out experimental research guided by theoretical models. The solidification of nanoparticle solutions upon dispense and the consecutive sintering process will be modelled by using a discretized particle model and a diffusive model. Further, a model that solves the Li diffusion equation coupled with stress evolution and the cracking in the porous electrode will be developed using a multi-scale modeling approach. These models will guide the additive fabrication experiments using high specific capacity materials such as silicon and silicon dioxide. The second objective is to identify relationships between the characteristics of an artificial coating on the electrode and the resistance to electrode capacity fade. The characteristics of the coating include the thickness and uniformity of the coated layer. To achieve this objective, atomic layer deposition will be used to create an electrode-electrolyte interface layer over the 3D porous electrodes. Several microscopic analyses such as atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy will be used to measure the coating thickness and uniformity. Battery electrochemical experiments will then be carried out and the resistance to capacity fade will be measured using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy."},{"AwardNumber":"1604092","Title":"Symmetry, Integrability, and Special Functions","NSFOrganization":"DMS","Program(s)":"ANALYSIS PROGRAM","StartDate":"05/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"12/18/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Mourad Ismail","State":"FL","Organization":"University of Central Florida","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Edward Taylor","EndDate":"04/30/2017","AwardedAmountToDate":"$25,000.00","Co-PIName(s)":"Xin Li","PIEmailAddress":"ismail@math.ucf.edu","OrganizationStreet":"4000 CNTRL FLORIDA BLVD","OrganizationCity":"ORLANDO","OrganizationState":"FL","OrganizationZip":"328168005","OrganizationPhone":"4078821120","NSFDirectorate":"MPS","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1281","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"7556","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"This award provides funding for the conference Symmetry, Integrability, and Special Functions, to be held at the Centre de Recherches Mathmatiques at the University of Montreal from July 3 to July 9, 2016.<br/><br/>The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of difference equations, orthogonal polynomials, and integrable systems.

Garcia-Garibay of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California-Los Angeles is establishing new synthetic strategies to transform simple chemicals into more complex, high value substances, by taking advantage of reactions that occur under the high order and rigidity of the crystalline state. Their strategy relies on the selection of structures that are known to form highly reactive intermediates when activated by the absorption of ultraviolet light. By executing those reactions in the crystalline state, instead of doing them in liquids, they are able to obtain nearly pure solid products with no need for solvents, catalysts or additional reagents. This project is in the SusChEM portfolio as the reactions do not use solvent and require no energy for the separation and removal of byproducts.

In the solid state, radical-radical combination reactions with retention of stereochemistry, and selective nitrene insertions occur. Photochemical reactions are carried out in well-characterized crystalline phases and their transformations from the solid phase of the reactant to the solid phase of the product are analyzed by thermal analysis and spectroscopic means. This characterization is done in order to determine the corresponding phase diagrams and the conditions required for clean and efficient reactions.

However, dissimilar metals cannot be joined using traditional fusion-based welding methods.

To achieve the first objective, joining samples will be prepared using the two joining processes under various process conditions. Local mechanical properties will be quantified through micro-cantilever, micro-hardness, and in situ scanning electron microscope testing. Joint performance will be measured through macro quasi-static tensile tests.

Among many others, the linear programming (LP) technique has played a central role in the area of approximation algorithms. This project seeks to understand the power of this technique, by exploiting a very flexible paradigm in designing LP-based algorithms, called the ""round-or-cut"" paradigm. The PI aims to use this paradigm to tackle many combinatorial optimizations problems that seem hard to tackle in other ways. Successful completion of the project will not only yield improved approximation algorithms for these problems, but also lead to a better understanding of the power of linear programming technique. As a part of the project, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained and involved in the research activities. The course materials resulting from this research project will be made freely accessible online.<br/><br/>Recently, the round-or-cut paradigm has led to many improved approximation algorithms. This paradigm differs from the traditional ""relax-and-round"" paradigm in that the LP relaxation used to approximate the problem does not need to be efficiently solvable. As a result, the round-or-cut paradigm has the flexibility that the rounding algorithm can adaptively choose the set of linear constraints to require the fractional solution to satisfy. The major goal of this project is to leverage this flexibility to tackle problems that seem hard to tackle using the traditional relax-and-round paradigm, including the capacitated k-median problem, the machine minimization problem on identical machines, and the unsplittable flow problem on paths. The second goal is to understand the gap between the round-or-cut paradigm and the traditional relax-and-round paradigm. So far, the relax-and-round paradigm is far more popular than the round-or-cut paradigm in designing LP-based approximation algorithms. For a few problems only, algorithms require the stronger round-or-cut paradigm. The PI will investigate whether the relax-and-round paradigm is sufficient for these problems."},{"AwardNumber":"1565928","Title":"CRII: SHF: FSM-Centric Approximate Computing --- A Disciplined Approach","NSFOrganization":"CCF","Program(s)":"CRII CISE Research Initiation","StartDate":"03/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"02/16/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Zhijia Zhao","State":"CA","Organization":"University of California-Riverside","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Tao Li","EndDate":"02/28/2018","AwardedAmountToDate":"$175,000.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"zhijia@cs.ucr.edu","OrganizationStreet":"Office of Research","OrganizationCity":"RIVERSIDE","OrganizationState":"CA","OrganizationZip":"925211000","OrganizationPhone":"9518275535","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"026Y","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"7798, 7941, 8228","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"This project proposes a new paradigm to enhance computing efficiency --- Finite State Machine (FSM)-centric approximate computing. Approximate computing has shown promise for both reducing energy consumption and improving performance across different applications, especially those in image processing, machine learning and data analytics.

Growing data volumes and limitations on computer processing power constrain FSM?s efficiency. The establishment of FSM-centric approximate computing will open the door to a new dimension of efficiency optimization for software applications.<br/><br/>This research will take advantage of the synergy between FSM computations and approximate computing --- the inherent error tolerance capability within FSM computations --- to develop a computing platform for exploring approximate FSM computations. The key idea is a quantitative analysis of FSM reliability that captures how errors generated by underlying approximate hardware propagate through FSM transitions.

Increasingly demanding programs are run by users on handheld platforms powered by batteries. Therefore, specialized hardware components, i.e., IP cores, are introduced to improve handhelds? energy efficiency. However, the memory access patterns of CPUs and IPs are dramatically different, making main memory a critical bottleneck for a handheld system. Non-volatile memories, particularly STT-MRAM, are emerging as replacements for the existing DRAM-based main memory, achieving a wide variety of advantages. Nevertheless, substituting DRAM with STT-MRAM in handhelds also results in new design challenges such as read disturbance. Consequently, two read disturbance mitigation schemes are proposed in this project, constructing a high performance and reliable memory framework for handheld platforms.<br/><br/>In this research, a flexible STT-MRAM read scheme, namely FlexRead, is proposed to optimize handheld platform performance and energy efficiency under read disturbance. FlexRead combines the advantages of two existing data sensing schemes, dynamically issuing the best sensing scheme based on the runtime system state. Furthermore, an application flow pattern prediction scheme, namely FlowPaP, is proposed to identify and remove unnecessary memory restores originally required for preventing read disturbance. FlowPaP analyzes the data flow behavior in the applications running on handhelds, recognizing that the memory is in a consistent loop of being alternately written and read. These two proposed schemes optimize multiple handheld platform design aspects, thus having a transformational impact on the handheld research community, industrial products, and even society. The discovered read disturbance issue is an important and realistic design challenge for future handheld platform generations.

However, high levels of distributed energy resources can change the behavior of the grid, with potential undesirable effects on the grid stability and power quality. This necessitates transformative approaches to coordinate the large number of distributed energy resources. These approaches need to handle the high uncertainty involved in the renewable generation and to call upon customers to actively participate. Additional challenges are placed by the still-undeveloped sensing, communication, and computation resources for the grid. To address these challenges, this CAREER proposal is to develop distributed coordination rules to optimize, control, and incentivize the distributed energy resources in order to ensure efficient, adaptive, and reliable performance of the grid. The proposal will integrate multidisciplinary approaches, in particular, mathematics, engineering, and economics. Results can also be transferred to other large-scale socio-technical systems, such as transportation systems and water/gas distribution systems. Broad impacts will follow from an integrated educational dissemination plan, involvement of undergraduates especially under-represented groups in research, transition of new ideas to industry, and outreach to the general public and K-12 students.<br/><br/>As a socio-technical system, two factors distinguish the power grid from other networks, its intrinsic physics and its close human interactions. Accordingly, this proposal will design automated distributed algorithms to optimize the performance of the energy resources at slow-time scales and to control them to ensure energy balance at fast-time scales, and design incentive schemes such as pricing, rewards, payoff, and trading rules to promote human participants to take desired actions. The automated algorithms will tackle the challenges brought by the power system physics (e.g. physical laws such as Kirchhoff's law and system dynamics such as swing dynamics), limited communication, and uncertain generation/consumption. The algorithms will also maximize the use of physics in order to lower sensing, communication, and computation overhead. The incentive schemes will tackle the challenges brought by the self-interested nature of humans. Owners of distributed energy resources are mostly profit-maximizing entities, seeking their own best interest and lacking incentives to reveal truthful private information. Lastly the proposal will jointly design the distributed architecture, algorithms and incentive schemes by strongly integrating the engineering and economics in order to ensure high-performance and high-confidence operation of distributed energy resources to facilitate a smoother transition for the grid into the next age of a smarter grid."},{"AwardNumber":"1553042","Title":"CAREER: Trading Communication and Storage for Computation to Enhance Energy Efficiency","NSFOrganization":"CCF","Program(s)":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION","StartDate":"02/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"01/29/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Ulya Karpuzcu","State":"MN","Organization":"University of Minnesota-Twin Cities","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"Tao Li","EndDate":"01/31/2021","AwardedAmountToDate":"$170,354.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"ukarpuzc@umn.edu","OrganizationStreet":"200 OAK ST SE","OrganizationCity":"Minneapolis","OrganizationState":"MN","OrganizationZip":"554552070","OrganizationPhone":"6126245599","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"7798","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"1045, 7941","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Looking forward, a fundamental challenge in computer systems is the Power Wall, where, due to imbalances in technology scaling, not all the compute engines that find place on chip can be powered on at the same time. The Power Wall is transforming all levels of the system stack, including the parallel architecture landscape. Communication power, as induced by data movement and the orchestration thereof, along with storage power, dominates computation power. As the degree of concurrency increases, communication power becomes even more prominent due to more frequent data transfers. At the same time, emerging memory technologies are not mature enough to keep up with the corresponding capacity, bandwidth, and performance requirements within a tight power budget. An amnesic processor, can minimize, if not eliminate, the power and performance overhead associated with data storage, retrieval, and communication, thus, operate more energy efficiently. The limited storage of the amnesic machine represents the short-term memory, which lacks long-term memory by construction.<br/><br/>When compared to its classic counterparts, an amnesic machine can facilitate more compute engines to occupy the area once devoted to (long-term) memory, which can further be harnessed for recomputation. Recomputation can transparently convert workloads to become more compute intensive such that they can make a better use of classic architectures optimized for performance, as opposed to energy efficiency. This project intends to unlock the energy efficiency premise of amnesic machines. To this end, the PI proposes to explore compiler and microarchitecture support to decide when to replace remote loads with re-computation. The research has three major thrusts: (i) at compiler time, integer linear programming based optimization will be performed to generate a probabilistic energy-minimal re-computation schedule; (ii) runtime controller will be designed to decide when to re-compute based on the information the compiler provides; and (iii) memory hierarchy will also be explored to maximize energy efficiency.

Fleming of the Department of Chemistry at Duquesne University will explore fundamentally new reactions of metalated nitriles. Preliminary results demonstrate the viability of several new reactivity patterns for alkylating alkenes, aromatics, and creating medium-sized carbocycles. Studies to expand and develop these forays into robust synthetic methods will be undertaken. Asymmetric alkylations of zincated and magnesiated nitriles will be performed through a combination of screening and mechanistic probes to address one of the most difficult challenges in the field: stereoselective alkylation of a chiral, metalated nitrile.<br/><br/>The research is likely to lead to new methods for stereoselectively assembling hindered, quaternary centers. Fields as diverse as medicine and materials rely on exactly this type of robust chemistry. The nitrile-based arylation is particularly well suited to the synthesis of several nitrile-containing pharmaceuticals and drug leads because the method uses an inexpensive, abundant copper catalyst rather than palladium catalysts that are currently required for the same transformation.<br/><br/>Three broader impacts will be reached through this research: institutional development, elevation of nitrile chemistry, and student training. As a teacher-scholar institution a strong emphasis is placed on undergraduate and graduate mentoring while pursuing research excellence.

Hydrous minerals in the slab break down when exposed to the high temperatures encountered at depth, releasing fluids ultimately involved in the creation of arc magmas and explosive arc volcanoes. In addition, these fluids are also thought to influence seismic slip behavior and the manifestation of earthquakes. Therefore, determining the sources and amount of fluids released at depth within a subduction is critical for understanding volcanic and earthquake behavior along plate margins.<br/><br/>Particular elements (for example, lithium, chlorine, and boron) are highly fluid-mobile, thereby making them excellent tracers of fluid source. These fluids impart diagnostic geochemical signatures to overlying material that can be used to trace mass transfer through subduction zones. This work will geochemically characterize cold and thermal spring waters from the Hikurangi (New Zealand subduction zone) accretionary prism to trace fluid sources along the fore-arc and quantify volatile flux through the fore-arc. Fluid sources to the fore-arc will be determined by examining variations in elemental concentrations (and ratios) and isotopic compositions. The data will be used to evaluate causal links between fluid sources and earthquake mechanics, such as shallow slow slip events. The Hikurangi margin is the ideal locality for this study due to the numerous exposed fore-arc springs, which allow a rare glimpse into the shallow part of the subduction zone, and the previously documented along arc variability in subduction parameters (e.g., amount of subducting sediment) and seismic slip behavior. Geochemical evidence for increased (or more shallow) dehydration reactions in the northern portion of the margin compared to the southern portion would support a link between dehydration reactions and shallow slow slip events."},{"AwardNumber":"1549618","Title":"STTR Phase I: Non-Touch Infant Vital Sign Monitor","NSFOrganization":"IIP","Program(s)":"STTR PHASE I","StartDate":"01/01/2016","LastAmendmentDate":"12/21/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Yiran Li","State":"TX","Organization":"yearONE LLC","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Jesus Soriano Molla","EndDate":"12/31/2016","AwardedAmountToDate":"$225,000.00","Co-PIName(s)":"Changzhi Li","PIEmailAddress":"yiran.li@ttu.edu","OrganizationStreet":"15527 Baybrook Dr","OrganizationCity":"Houston","OrganizationState":"TX","OrganizationZip":"770628111","OrganizationPhone":"7133034757","NSFDirectorate":"ENG","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1505","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"1505, 8018, 8038, 8042","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase-I project is to improve the detection of cessation of respiration with regard to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

A provocative study of the lithium isotopic composition of the oldest minerals on Earth - the >4.0 billion year old zircons from ancient sedimentary rocks in the Jack Hills, western Australia, reported highly variable isotopic compositions. In particular, the very light Li observed in some of these zircons was suggested to reflect intense chemical weathering of the earliest crust on Earth, implying high surface temperatures, possibly acidic waters and intense rainfall. This interpretation, however, rests on the assumption that Li in zircon faithfully records the isotopic composition of the magma from which they crystallized and has not been influenced by processes such as Li diffusion through the zircon. In this project, the team seeks to quantify whether Li diffuses in natural zircons and under what conditions. They will do this with a two-pronged approach: a) in situ analyses of Li isotopes in natural zircons that show chemically distinct cores and rims, and b) by experimental investigations of synthetic, Li-bearing zircons that have been subjected to heating under different conditions. The results should lead to the more general use of Li isotopes in zircon as a speedometer for geologic processes and for tracing the origins of magmas. <br/><br/>2)<br/>Researchers seek to investigate under what circumstances Li diffuses in the mineral zircon. Unusually light Li isotopes iin ancient zircons from the Hadean eon of Earth history (>4.0 billion years) have been interpreted to reflect incorporation of highly weathered materials into the sources of the granitic magmas in which the zircons are inferred to have crystallized. The implication is that the Hadean Earth had continents that rose above sea level and that this crust was exposed to intense chemical weathering due to high surface temperatures, acidic water and intense rainfall. An alternative interpretation, supported by experimentally determined diffusion coefficients for Li in zircon, is that the light Li was generated via kinetic fractionation during Li diffusion. However, most natural zircons show no evidence for Li diffusion, for example, they show no progressive zoning in Li isotopes (within the 10-25 m resolution of ion probe spots), and they show abrupt concentration steps in Li. Unraveling which of these interpretations is correct has important implications for understanding the Hadean Earth. This team will undertake an investigation of both natural and synthesized zircons in order to address the question of whether Li readily diffuses in zircon. Natural zircons whose Li distribution has been mapped using time of flight (ToF) SIMS will be analyzed for their isotopic compositions using NanoSIMS to see if there is any evidence of Li diffusion across sharp Li concentration boundaries. Zircons synthesized under a variety of pressure, temperature and rare earth element concentrations, will be characterized for their P and REE concentrations and distributions. These synthetic zircons will then be exposed to variable Li concentrations, and heating experiments followed by analyses of their isotopic compositions, as well as Si, Sc, Ti, and Y concentrations using NanoSIMS. The results of this project will lead to a much better understanding of Li diffusion in zircon, which, in turn, will open the door towards using Li in zircon to trace sources of evolved igneous rocks (if Li diffusion is found to be insignificant), the timescale of magmatic processes (if Li diffusion commonly occurs), or possibly both if Li diffusion occurs in some instances, but not in others. It is conceivable that both may occur, depending on the atomic Li/REE ratios of the zircon of interest."},{"AwardNumber":"1600896","Title":"CAREER: Approximate Computing Systems for Future Teraflops Workloads","NSFOrganization":"CCF","Program(s)":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION","StartDate":"08/21/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"10/14/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Nam Sung Kim","State":"IL","Organization":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"Tao Li","EndDate":"12/31/2016","AwardedAmountToDate":"$91,231.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"nskim@illinois.edu","OrganizationStreet":"SUITE A","OrganizationCity":"CHAMPAIGN","OrganizationState":"IL","OrganizationZip":"618207473","OrganizationPhone":"2173332187","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"7798","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"1045","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"The performance of computers has improved tremendously in the past four decades, which has enabled innumerable applications that have major roles in our daily lives. However, without dramatic innovations in improving power efficiency of computing, the continued semiconductor device scaling alone will fail to provide sufficient performance for the future computing capabilities.

The novelty of the approach lies in developing power- and performance-efficient computing systems with software support by exploiting the characteristics of future workloads that often use complex probabilistic mathematical models of physical phenomena. In such applications, approximate computing can often result in satisfactory outcomes. Meanwhile, it can dramatically decrease power consumption or increase performance by replacing complete logic functions with simplified circuits that mimic the functions for rough calculations. To extend the approximate computing concept to more general-purpose computing systems, the following holistic approaches are proposed: 1) intelligent microarchitectures to identify correctness-non-critical regions of code with compiler support; 2) approximate computing engines to execute such regions of code power and performance efficiently; 3) high-level morphic primitives to process a large fraction of workloads with orders-of-magnitude greater power and performance efficiency; and 4) flexible architectures to allow programmers and users to trade the quality of computing with the efficiency. <br/><br/>The proposed research will have a specific and significant impact on the computer architecture, circuit, and compiler communities since it requires analysis of interesting and representative workloads; realization of state-of-the-art circuit, architecture, and compiler infrastructure; and invention of powerful and useful evaluation methodologies.

Plants, including crops, respond to cues from the environment in many ways. Among these responses are changes in the ways that genes are expressed. Understanding and manipulating these changes are likely to be profitable means for improving crop productivity. The subject of this research is a protein (termed AtCPSF30) that is important for the responses of plants to environmental stresses, as well as to other cues (or developmental signals) that guide development from a seedling to a mature and productive plant. The goals of the research are to understand how this protein helps the plant to discriminate between different cues, so that subsequent changes in gene expression are appropriate to the respective stress or developmental signal. This research will lead to a better understanding of how plants respond to environmental stresses, and to how stresses affect different aspects of growth and development. This understanding will allow scientists to develop improved crop varieties, and will help producers to make informed decisions regarding crop and variety choice, as well as production management. <br/><br/>Technical description of the project:<br/><br/>The subject of this study is a hypothetical hub that transduces cellular signaling cues into differential poly(A) site choices and phenotypic outcomes. This hub, the 30 kD subunit of the so-called Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor in Arabidopsis (AtCPSF30), is regulated in vitro by two distinctive chemical or biochemical signals (calcium and redox signals), and is involved in a range of developmental and physiological responses.

Room-temperature rechargeable Na-ion batteries can be competitive to Li-ion batteries due to their lower cost and the widespread availability of the sodium resources. While tremendous research is focused on Li-ion batteries worldwide, scientific challenges associated with room-temperature rechargeable sodium-ion batteries have been relatively unexplored. This is of prime importance considering that Li resources are very limited and their price has increased continuously during the past 20 years. The challenges of Na-ion batteries are much more complicated than the Li-ion case, as Na-ions are larger than Li-ions by 70 percent, which induces large mechanical stresses upon driving the Na-ions into the host electrode. The entry of sodium into the electrodes triggers complicated chemical reactions and failures that are poorly understood, and the battery life is reduced drastically.<br/><br/>An important challenge in the broad use of Na-ion batteries is the very low cycling stability in service conditions.

On the other hand, many licensed spectrum blocks are left unused. Although cognitive radios (CR) technology has emerged as an enabler for unlicensed users to opportunistically access the unused licensed spectrum, most previous works commonly assume that each user is equipped with a CR which can operate across a wide range of spectrum. This may be possible in theory, but may not be practical for light-weight devices such as cell phones. How to effectively utilize the CR technology to build more flexible networks so that even non-CR capable devices can benefit from the opportunistic access to the unused spectrum is therefore in dire need.<br/><br/>In this project, the PIs propose a novel cognitive mesh assisted cellular network (CMCN) and investigate: 1) the architectural design of CMCN so that unoccupied licensed spectrum can be efficiently utilized and non-cognitive cellular devices can benefit from the CR technology, 2) spectrum and energy efficient CR mesh router placement under uncertain spectrum availability, 3) how to construct a fine-grained spectrum map to facilitate efficient spectrum allocation and intelligent traffic delivery, and 4) experimental validation and implementation for the proposed design. The research outcome provides a viable solution to the spectrum congestion in cellular systems. Moreover, with this flexible architecture, telecommunication industries can be rejuvenated with new innovations, leading to further development of cellular networks with high capacity and better support of new applications such as mobile healthcare, which has significant impact on individuals' lives and further provides greater opportunities for job creation and economic growth.

A typical CPS consists of physical dynamics, sensors, communication network and controllers. The communication network is of key importance in CPS, since it mimics the nerve system in the human body. Hence, it is critical to study how the communication network in CPS should be analyzed and designed. Essentially, communications stem from the uncertainty of system under consideration; random perturbations increase the system uncertainty, which is reduced by the control actions in CPS. It is well known that entropy is a measure of system uncertainty. A unified framework of entropy is used for CPS, in which random perturbations create entropy while communications and controls provide negative entropy to compensate the entropy generation. The intellectual merits are the novel framework of entropy for bridging the communications and control in CPS and the new design criterion based on the entropy of system state for CPS. The project's broader significance and importance are the education of various levels of students, the dissemination of results to public, and the impact on everyday life such as the improved agility and robustness of power grids.<br/><br/>This project applies the framework of entropy to study the interdependencies of communications and control, thus facilitating the analysis and design of communications in CPS. The following tasks are tackled in the project: (a) Entropy Flow Based Communication Capacity Analysis in which communications in CPS is analyzed by studying the entropy fields in the physical dynamics, thus providing an estimation on the scale (bits/second) of communication capacity budget; (b) Communication Network Topology Design in which the design of the network topology (either physical or logical) is tackled through both optimization-based or heuristic approaches; (c) Online Network Resource Scheduling which refines the network resource scheduling during the operation using both optimization-based and heuristic approaches, within the framework of entropy fields; (d) Hardware Emulation Testbed which delivers a co-simulation testbed based on real time digital power simulator (RTDS) and a communication simulator, in the context of smart grids.

This variability raises issues regarding proper pricing mechanisms for electric power in systems with high levels of renewable generation. The research objective of this project is to explore a new fundamental market-based mechanism for managing the uncertainty caused by high levels of renewable generation or renewable energy sources (RES). The key concept of the proposed mechanism is to charge uncertain sources and credit flexible sources based on Uncertainty Marginal Price (UMP), which represents the marginal cost of immunizing the next increment of uncertainty at a specific location. Management of uncertainty is one of the key issues that must be dealt with to have seamless high-level penetration of RES. The clear price signals and incentives developed in this project have the potential to remove a critical barrier to distributed RES, which in turn will promote energy independence and reduce environmental impact, contributing to the goal of a low-carbon economy. The proposed UMP concept enriches the fundamentals of electricity market theory and opens a new door for future research.<br/><br/>This research project will, for the first time, provide explicit price signals and utilize a market mechanism to manage any level of uncertainty using a robust optimization framework.

UMP provides important price signals for both the<br/>market operation and investment related to uncertainty and flexibility. In the short term, the proposed market-based mechanism provides incentives for RES operators to improve forecasting accuracy (i.e., to reduce uncertainties). It also provides incentives for existing flexible resources (e.g., gas-fired generating units) to contribute reserves for uncertainty accommodation. In the long term, the proposed mechanism provides price signals for siting new flexible resources (e.g., energy storage) to accommodate uncertainties from increasing RES penetration."},{"AwardNumber":"1522768","Title":"Novel Ideas and Analysis for Interface and Fluid-Structure Interaction Problems and Applications","NSFOrganization":"DMS","Program(s)":"COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS","StartDate":"09/15/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"09/11/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Zhilin Li","State":"NC","Organization":"North Carolina State University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Leland M.

Recently, this question has been brought to the forefront by climate change and landscape conversion. Due to the processes of climate change, habitat regions suitable for population growth of many species have been shifting geographically. Climatically induced shifts may interface with population demographic processes in complex ways, setting the stage for impacts on species population growth and spread, long-term dynamics and interactions between species. This project aims to produce new frameworks for the analysis of persistence and spreading speeds of species in a shifting habitat. It addresses the question of how ecosystems are being affected by climate change and how ecosystems might respond in the future. It contributes to the growing body of information identifying species at a high risk for extinction and predicting the spread of invasive species under ongoing climate change. The outcomes of the project help improve strategies for coping with challenges of natural resource management. This project further stimulates interdisciplinary collaboration between mathematicians and biologists to address issues beyond the reach of single disciplines. In addition, it contributes to human resources development, focusing on training and skill development of graduate students, and providing them with experience in interdisciplinary interaction and exploration. <br/><br/>In this project, the investigator formulates and analyzes spatial population models that describe species growth, interactions, and dispersal in shifting habitats. The goal is to understand and accurately describe how climate change affects biological invasion processes. Multi-species reaction-diffusion competition models and predator-prey models, as well as semi-discrete stage-structured spatial models with a shifting habitat edge, are studied to emphasize the role of changing habitat suitability in persistence and spread of an invasive species interacting with an existing species. In these models, shifts in habitat ranges are incorporated in species growth functions that propagate as traveling waves. Species spatial dynamics are investigated for the following cases: (i) one species spreads into a shifting habitat preoccupied by a resident species; and (ii) two species consecutively invade an open shifting habitat and the earlier species is still in the process of expanding its spatial range. New techniques are developed to determine the behaviors of solutions of the models on appropriate bounded and unbounded spatial intervals that expand and shift in time. Methods from differential equations, integral equations, and dynamical systems are employed to detect conditions under which species go extinct and to determine spreading speeds of persisting species in space. The results of this research also have impacts in other disciplines where wave propagation is studied."},{"AwardNumber":"1525485","Title":"IUSE: Collaborative Project: Engaged Student Learning: Design and Development, Level I: Broadening the Path to the STEM Profession Through Cybersecurity Learning","NSFOrganization":"DUE","Program(s)":"IUSE","StartDate":"09/15/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"09/11/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Xiangyang Li","State":"MD","Organization":"Johns Hopkins University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Michael Erlinger","EndDate":"08/31/2018","AwardedAmountToDate":"$150,001.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"xyli@jhu.edu","OrganizationStreet":"3400 N CHARLES ST","OrganizationCity":"Baltimore","OrganizationState":"MD","OrganizationZip":"212182608","OrganizationPhone":"4105168668","NSFDirectorate":"EHR","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1998","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"8209, 9178, SMET","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"The significance and importance of this project resides in the diversification and broadening of the STEM talent pipeline in cybersecurity in predominantly undergraduate and liberal arts schools (small institutions).

Interested students can study further by taking two cybersecurity focused courses and cybersecurity capstone projects created by this project. Using all these materials students can create a cybersecurity concentration. Second, the project will use the Global Environment for Network Innovation (GENI) infrastructure in the development of empirical labs and the capstone project assignments. GENI offers an affordable cloud solution to small institutions that lack the infrastructure to support sophisticated computer labs. The learning impact of the new curriculum will be evaluated by quantitative competency assessments that are administered yearly. Student cybersecurity persistence will be assessed by a longitudinal study of the number of cybersecurity courses taken during a student's course of study. Qualitative assessment of the curriculum will take the form of student interviews and focus groups to gauge attitude towards course modules, perception of learning gains and comfort level with the pedagogies employed. In addition to the collaboration of three college level institutions, this project will leverage relationships with local community colleges to further develop a cybersecurity workforce. This partnership provides a diverse set of students that will support the evidence-based evaluation of student cybersecurity learning via this approach."},{"AwardNumber":"1557727","Title":"QuBBD: Collaborative Research: Advancing mHealth using Big Data Analytics: Statistical and Dynamical Systems Modeling of Real-Time Adaptive m-Intervention for Pain","NSFOrganization":"DMS","Program(s)":"","StartDate":"09/15/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"09/10/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Jingyi Jessica Li","State":"CA","Organization":"University of California-Los Angeles","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Nandini Kannan","EndDate":"08/31/2016","AwardedAmountToDate":"$33,762.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"jli@stat.ucla.edu","OrganizationStreet":"11000 Kinross Avenue, Suite 211","OrganizationCity":"LOS ANGELES","OrganizationState":"CA","OrganizationZip":"900952000","OrganizationPhone":"3107940102","NSFDirectorate":"MPS","ProgramElementCode(s)":"O402","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"With the growing popularity of mobile phone technology, new opportunities have arisen for real-time adaptive medical intervention. The simultaneous growth of multiple ""big data"" sources (e.g., mobile health data, electronic health records, lab test results, genomic data) allows for the development of personalized recommendations. This award supports initiation of a collaborative research project that will generate a new mathematical model for changes in subjective pain over time in patients with chronic conditions. The model will be combined with statistical techniques to ultimately obtain optimized, continuously-updated treatment plans balancing competing demands of pain reduction and medication minimization. Those resulting personalized treatment plans will be incorporated into a currently active pilot study on mobile intervention in patients living with chronic pain due to sickle cell disease (SCD). Since nearly a quarter of patient visits to the emergency room are for conditions that could have been managed as outpatients, it is crucial to improve mobile health technologies to allow these patients to quickly recognize and receive appropriate health care information. <br/><br/>There currently is no standard algorithm or analytical method for real-time adaptive treatment recommendations for chronic conditions like pain. Furthermore, current state-of-the-art methods have difficulty in handling continuous-time decision optimization using big data. The proposed model will consist of a dynamical systems approach using differential equations to forecast future pain levels, as well as a statistical approach tying system parameters to patient data (including reported pain levels, medication history, personal characteristics and other health records). A third key component will be the development and pilot study of a new control and optimization strategy to balance the competing demands of pain reduction and drug dosage minimization.

Some applications involve long-term exposure to blood, such as heart valve replacements and stents. Other applications require intermediate-term or short-term contact. These include applications such as blood storage and medical procedures like dialysis and blood oxygenation. The materials used in these applications induce undesirable (and potentially catastrophic) blood-material interactions, such as blood clotting and inflammation. In fact, the only known surface that is compatible with flowing whole blood for long-term contact is the inside surfaces of blood vessels. This work will develop new surfaces that have chemical and structural features designed to mimic the inside surfaces of blood vessels. We will also study how the chemistry and structure of these new surfaces can be tuned to control interactions with important blood proteins that regulate blood-material interactions, like clotting. This will enable us to better design materials for blood-contacting applications.<br/><br/>This work will prepare dense polymer brushes containing glycosaminoglycans, which are the polyanionic polysaccharides in the endothelial glycocalyx presented by the cells lining blood vessel walls. The interactions of important blood proteins with these glycocalyx mimics will be investigated by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy experiments. These experiments will be used to test new hypotheses about how blood-compatibility is determined by protein-surface interactions and protein-protein interactions at surfaces. Finally we will demonstrate that glycocalyx mimics result in reduced platelet adhesion and activation, and decrease the propensity for blood to clot.<br/><br/>This work will lead to better understanding of the mechanisms whereby interactions of blood components with blood vessel walls prevent blood clotting. By understanding how the blood vessel wall prevents clotting we can better design blood-contacting surfaces for many applications in cardiovascular medicine and biotechnology. The findings from this research could also lead to advances in handling other complex protein mixtures in applications such as protein separation for the food and biopharmaceutical industries. Our education and outreach activities will include a one-week summer short course for middle school students, a symposium for a middle school students at a charter school that serves low-income and minority students, and contributions to a new textbook being authored by a co-PI."},{"AwardNumber":"1511941","Title":"SusChem: Collaborative Research: Role of Biofilms in Engineered Infiltration Systems in the Removal of Bacteria in Urban Stormwater","NSFOrganization":"CBET","Program(s)":"ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","StartDate":"08/15/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"08/21/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Yusong Li","State":"NE","Organization":"University of Nebraska-Lincoln","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"William Cooper","EndDate":"07/31/2018","AwardedAmountToDate":"$33,397.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"yli7@unl.edu","OrganizationStreet":"2200 Vine St, 151 Whittier","OrganizationCity":"Lincoln","OrganizationState":"NE","OrganizationZip":"685031435","OrganizationPhone":"4024723171","NSFDirectorate":"ENG","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1440","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"021E, 8248, 9150","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"1511915(Chen) & 1511941(Li)<br/><br/>Urbanization has resulted in a significant increase in surfaces which prevent stormwater from infiltrating the subsurface and recharging the groundwater.

A disruptive event in Bangkok can stop production in Beijing, and in turn hamper product delivery in Boston. Such events materialize in various, sometimes unexpected forms: natural disasters, labor protests, utility outage, cyber-attacks, political shifts, and epidemic outbreaks, to name a few. They can lead to cascading supply chain failures and business continuity interruptions, with potentially severe near- and long-term physical, financial, and reputational consequences. The key barrier to the effective management of supply chain disruptions is the limited visibility into the interconnected supply network structure and the associated risk profiles. For example, the Department of Defense has specifically highlighted limited visibility of supply chain structures and risks as items of high strategic risks in 2015. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project directly addresses this challenge. It develops predictive analytics, risk learning and mitigation strategies that can be readily deployed by firms and organizations to increase visibility and control of their supply chain risks. The data driven approach is particularly useful to organizations with complex supply chains, such as multinational firms and governmental agencies, to better measure the distribution and impact of supply network risks, and proactively manage such risks and achieve better supply chain resilience.<br/><br/>While existing theories assume perfect knowledge of supply network structure and the associated risk profiles, this research follows a two-pronged approach to directly account for and mitigate limited visibility. First, it develops a series of empirical models that increase visibility into supply chain risks and their driving factors, with a particular emphasis on network-driven risk interdependencies. It is the first research to combine automated textual analysis (topic coding and sentiment analysis) and high-dimensional statistical analysis, to isolate supply risk information from large scale, qualitative data. Specifically, the project will quantify the language of corporate disclosures and user generated content on social media to 1) characterize risk distributions and interdependencies, 2) quantify the impacts of these risks on both immediate and sub-tier supply chain partners, and 3) identify early-warning factors and develop predictive models for risk events. Second, leveraging insights gained from the empirical results, this project develops new quantitative models on risk learning and mitigation that address and account for limited visibility. One class of models focuses on optimal risk learning given complete knowledge of supply network but incomplete knowledge of risks. The other class of models focuses on designing optimal risk mitigation strategies with general incomplete information. The model addresses effectiveness of direct (procuring excess inventory and multi-sourcing) versus indirect (supply contracts) mitigation strategies in a game-theoretic framework."},{"AwardNumber":"1511915","Title":"SusChEM: Collaborative Research: Role of Biofilms in Engineered Infiltration Systems in the Removal of Bacteria in Urban Stormwater","NSFOrganization":"CBET","Program(s)":"ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING","StartDate":"08/15/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"08/21/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Kai Loon Chen","State":"MD","Organization":"Johns Hopkins University","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"William Cooper","EndDate":"07/31/2018","AwardedAmountToDate":"$115,877.00","Co-PIName(s)":"Sarah Preheim","PIEmailAddress":"kailoon.chen@jhu.edu","OrganizationStreet":"3400 N CHARLES ST","OrganizationCity":"Baltimore","OrganizationState":"MD","OrganizationZip":"212182608","OrganizationPhone":"4105168668","NSFDirectorate":"ENG","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1440","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"021E, 8248","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"1511915(Chen) & 1511941(Li)<br/><br/>Urbanization has resulted in a significant increase in surfaces which prevent stormwater from infiltrating the subsurface and recharging the groundwater.

The focus of this project is on the fabrication of such icosahedral quasicrystalline nanoparticles. Application of these particles in self assembly is expected to result in a three dimensional icosahedral quasicrystalline pattern, and will aid in understanding the importance of factors affecting the stability of icosahedral quasicrystalline structure.

Notably CU accepts many first generation college students. This work gives these students a rare opportunity to observe and participate in scientific research and discovery, stimulating their interest toward, and boosting their confidence in developing careers in science and technology. It also adds to the enrichment of our knowledge in the field of nanotechnology in the form of peer-reviewed publications and presentations at conferences. Additionally the project is integrated into eight undergraduate physics and nanotechnology courses, directly impacting the education of approximately one hundred students per year.

Experimental conditions are adjusted to generate particles of either spherical or dodecahedral pentagonal morphologies for different applications. Out of multiple potential applications, the researchers focus on studying self-assembly of said nanoparticles. Due to the unique dodecahedral pentagonal morphology of the selected nanoparticles, assembly of a three dimensional icosahedral quasicrystalline structure is expected.

Toward this goal, Professor Freedman is using synthetic chemistry with the aim of addressing the fundamental questions surrounding the creation of a qubit at the molecular level. Professor Freedman will integrate research and education through three new initiatives. In the first initiative, the primary literature will be incorporated into the introductory chemistry curriculum through a combination of demonstrations, lecture examples and student created Wikipedia pages. In a separate initiative, Professor Freedman will continue her work with the Museum of Science and Industry to design and implement a new exhibit, which features her research on magnetic anisotropy.

Electronic spin is an appealing qubit candidate because the qubits can be manipulated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and their parameters can be tuned using chemical synthesis.

As such, the synthesis and fundamental study of molecules with long-lived quantum coherences necessitates rational synthetic design principles to inform and enable the design of future long-lived qubits.

Glutamate is one such molecule, which is not only an amino acid needed for the synthesis of proteins, but also the most important neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, responsible for the majority of excitatory neurotransmission. Glutamate is transported across the plasma membrane through active glutamate transporters, which play essential roles in controlling the levels of glutamate in the mammalian brain and other tissue. This project explores the fundamental principles by which these transporters work. Understanding these principles is important because it will contribute to our knowledge not only of the role of glutamate and nutrient movement between cellular compartments in the mammalian brain, as well as other organs of the body, but also glutamate homeostasis, which is important for cellular function in general. Furthermore, the developed methods for analyzing transport will be applicable to potential future studies of other neurotransmitter and/or nutrient transporters and membrane proteins. On the educational level, the project provides an invaluable opportunity for undergraduate students to become involved in cutting-edge biophysical research, providing training in basic physical, quantitative approaches to be applied to a significant biological problem. The investigator is continuing previous efforts of undergraduate involvement (including members of under-represented groups), which has led to many publications with undergraduate students as co-authors, as well as students successfully moving on to careers in research. The investigator is also very active in local and regional activities that promote the sciences at all levels, including demonstrations at schools, science fair involvement, and assuming leadership roles in the local American Chemical Society (ACS) section and the Science Olympiad. Such activities are necessary to ensure a vibrant local science community and to foster excitement of the upcoming generations of young scientists for science and research. <br/><br/>Active glutamate transport is a multi-step process that requires multiple ion/substrate binding steps, as well as conformational changes. Despite recent progress towards understanding the transport process through functional studies, as well as the identification of structural models of a bacterial homologue of mammalian glutamate transporters in several states, basic questions about the mechanism, specificity, and dynamics of interaction of the transporters with cations, in particular K+ and Li+, as well as the energetic contributions to energy barriers that control the transport rate and specific structural changes in the transport cycle remain unresolved. Answers to these questions are obtained by applying a combination of experimental and computational methods, allowing the investigation of the dynamics of glutamate transport in real time, with microsecond time resolution, and to test predictions from all-atom and simplified molecular models. This work has the potential to reveal new aspects of glutamate movement across the cellular membrane, in particular with respect to the cooperation of polar and non-polar forces, which are fine tuned to adjust the energy barriers associated with ion/substrate binding, as well as conformational changes. The novel insight may uncover more general concepts that are employed by membrane transport proteins, in order to provide a permeation pathway for polar molecules across the hydrophobic membrane."},{"AwardNumber":"1558889","Title":"Collaborative Research: Planning Reliable and Resilient Transportation Networks against Correlated Infrastructure Disruptions","NSFOrganization":"CMMI","Program(s)":"CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS","StartDate":"07/15/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"09/23/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Xiaopeng Li","State":"FL","Organization":"University of South Florida","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Elise D.

However, as the system size scales, the power and energy consumption of these heterogeneous multiprocessors vastly exceed the budget. The primary focus of the project is to develop energy efficient techniques that can be implemented in the GPU with proper coordination with the CPUs. Energy reduction in GPU-based heterogeneous multiprocessors can be achieved by extending current CPU techniques to GPU. The project develops new runtime techniques for GPU core scaling and Dynamic Voltage and Frequency scaling (DVFS), and combines them with basic changes in algorithms and data structures to improve energy efficiency. <br/><br/>Existing models for performance and energy consumption assume 100% utilization of the processing cores and perfect overlap with memory access during execution. This project develops a more accurate model for energy efficiency taking into account the algorithm, data structure, caching and memory coalescing for different applications. A runtime system is being developed that monitors the GPU core and memory utilizations together with the energy consumption while executing an application. The runtime adjusts the number of cores and/or frequency level dynamically through prediction, but continues to make corrections as the execution proceeds. The runtime is extended to heterogeneous systems consisting of both CPU and GPU.<br/>The current DVFS techniques for scientific computing applications cannot fully eliminate slacks, therefore, are not energy optimal. By leveraging the algorithmic characteristics, a frequency scheduling technique is developed for linear algebra applications to achieve better energy efficiency.<br/>The project optimizes the energy efficiency while partitioning and designing tasks of an application. Without loss of generality, Cholesky factorization is used as an example and an energy efficient scheduler is developed. <br/><br/>The project develops software products that can be readily applied to existing large scale heterogeneous computers executing scientific applications that are suitable for defense, energy and critical infrastructure projects. Also applications like weather forecasting and structural dynamics are developed that have a great impact on society.

Along these lines, calculus courses are a gateway to STEM majors and careers; however, the national success rate in these courses is still too low. The premise of the project is that to increase student learning and success in calculus courses, a shift in teaching practices will need to occur. While past efforts have produced a variety of best practices for teaching calculus, these practices are still not used as widely as desired. The University of Central Florida (UCF) MATH-GAINS project will create a departmental model that can be used to address this national need. First, MATH-GAINS will develop a culture in which Department of Mathematics faculty members persistently apply best practices in their teaching of calculus courses. Instructors will work in teams to learn about and practice these teaching strategies and measure student learning in their courses. The project will provide professional development, feedback, and opportunities for reflection. The process of adopting these teaching strategies will be studied to identify the factors that enable faculty at a large, research-intensive university to successfully implement such methods so that the model could be adapted by other departments and institutions. Additionally, MATH-GAINS will allow studies of best teaching practices for postsecondary calculus. A target group of 30 students will be persistently impacted over the three-semester calculus sequence, resulting in increased student understanding of the mathematics, retention and graduation rates for these students, and knowledge about the cumulative effect of evidence-based instruction for researchers and faculty. <br/><br/>The MATH-GAINS project will build on research-based change strategies, and its implementation design will use critical features identified by those theories of change to shift the culture of mathematics faculty.

Each year, learning communities consisting of faculty members and graduate teaching assistants will learn from the literature, select from a menu of evidence-based teaching practices, develop learning materials for projects involving those practices, and implement their projects during both fall and spring semesters. The Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol will be used to assess the level of implementation of evidence-based practices, prompt faculty reflection, and suggest avenues for improvement. Faculty will collect data on student learning to assess the effectiveness of their implemented practices for diverse student populations in calculus. On-going evaluation will build the knowledge base for the creation of a model for institutional change, where application of evidence based teaching practices in calculus becomes standard and perpetual faculty practice.

Biological (bacteria) and non-biological (soil particles) natural colloids are ubiquitous in groundwater. The transport of pathogens (biological colloids) is relevant to producing safe drinking water, and the transport of heavy metals as facilitated by colloids (non-biological colloids) in groundwater has been widely recognized as a serious public concern. Almost all natural colloids are anisotropic in nature, being non-spherical in shape and possessing varied degrees of heterogeneity in surface charge. This project addresses the limitations of our current understanding of transport and fate of colloidal particles in porous media that stem from approximations of spherical shape and uniform surface charge used in previous studies. An improved understanding of colloid transport and retention in the environment will provide critical knowledge needed for producing safe drinking water and protecting sustainable water resources, essential steps for human health and development. Results from this work will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate curriculums.

Systematic experiments using laboratory-prepared rod-shaped colloidal particles with various aspect ratios and surface-charge heterogeneity will be analyzed in novel ways. Applications of cutting-edge methodologies in microelectronics, high-resolution mass sensing, optical microscopy, and laser-scanning cytometry will enable observations of colloid attachment rates on the surfaces and pore throats of the mineral grains comprising porous media and reveal phenomena appropriate to scaling up observations to aquifers. In parallel, a numerical simulation model that is capable of tracking both the movement and orientation of anisotropic colloids within porous media will be developed.

The semi&#8208;conductor industry now faces the infamous power and utilization walls, that is, physical constraints such as levels of power and energy consumption, but also reliability of the various components, must be taken into account not only during the chip fabrication process, but also when generating machine code and during program execution. To meet these challenges, heterogeneity in design, both at the architecture and technology levels, will be the prevailing approach for energy efficient computing as specialized cores, accelerators, and graphical processing units (GPUs) can eliminate the energy overheads of general&#8208;purpose homogeneous cores. However, with future technological challenges pointing in the direction of on&#8208;chip heterogeneity, and because of the traditional difficulty of parallel programming, it becomes imperative to produce new system software stacks that can take advantage of the heterogeneous hardware. <br/><br/>This project proposes to rethink the whole hardware&#8208;software interface, by researching novel ways to design many&#8208;core chip architectures and weaving heterogeneous components together and binding them by a fast and energy efficient on&#8208;chip interconnection network. On top of it will lay a system software layer to efficiently drive applications and map them onto the best suited components of the chip. Both the hardware and software layer are encompassed by a novel execution model, which describes how to orchestrate the various parts of a program in the most efficient way (be it with respect to power and energy, performance, or reliability). To achieve these goals, the development of a new model of computation called SPARTA (Stream-based Processor And RunTime Architecture) is proposed. The proposed model combines a new runtime and compiler technology with a hierarchical heterogeneous many&#8208;core chip and features hardware mechanisms for stream&#8208;based fine&#8208;grain program execution models to be reflected in different new software/hardware systems. Many issues are be envisioned, including programmability, scalability, performance evaluation, and power efficiency. Specifically, the goal is to identify the major challenges and obstacles toward an efficient exploitation of parallelism and scalability. To do so, traditional approaches will be re-evaluated by studying a collection of representative programs. A vertical design methodology is then proposed to effectively address the above challenges through the SPARTA approach and its implementation. In particular, the proposed cross-layer methodology consists of (a) a programming/execution model that will combine the Codelet model (leveraging our past research in dataflow models and extensions) with generalized streams: the Streaming Codelets, (b) an architecture model that will efficiently support the Streaming Codelets in heterogeneous hardware, and (c) a system software Stack that will be capable of effectively mapping Streaming Codelets to the proposed architecture. Finally, a qualitative and quantitative study of SPARTA will be performed via selected benchmarks and a consolidated methodology based on experimentation and analysis.

Consequently, the design of low latency, high bandwidth, power-efficient and reliable Network-on-Chips (NoCs) is proving to be one of the most critical challenges to achieving the performance potential of future chips. While multicores are facilitating an enormous integration capacity, aggressive transistor scaling has also led to a steady degradation of the device and circuit reliability. Increased device wear-out (due to negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI), electro migration (EM) and hot carrier injection (HCI)) has exacerbated the waning reliability of transistors, thereby resulting in a significant increase in faults (both permanent and transient), and hardware failures. As faults manifest within the NoC substrate, multicore chips are faced with excessive delays and increased power consumption while recovering from the fault. While NoC reliability research has made significant strides at inter- and intra-router levels, there is still a lack of a holistic design approach covering the reliability of the entire NoC architecture, from device wear-out, to links and routers, to routing protocols, to applications in a cohesive manner.<br/><br/>This project will develop a holistic design methodology that addresses the reliability of the entire NoC communication infrastructure (device, links, routers, routing algorithms, and topology) while minimizing energy footprint, reducing the area overhead and only marginally impacting performance. To achieve our goal of improving link fault-recovery, this project will develop techniques to maximize the utilization of the inter-router links with minimum power and area overhead. For the router, this project will propose intra-router reliability techniques with the goals of maximizing hardware utilization, reducing redundancy and area overhead, and minimizing router pipeline latency. Further, wear-leveling techniques developed by this project will improve the reliability of NoCs and the lifetime of the chip. Finally, the proposed techniques will be evaluated by developing fault models that are injected into the NoC and evaluate the fault coverage, performance degradation and energy efficiency through extensive modeling and simulation. The holistic design methodology spanning the entire NoC architecture and the reliability techniques developed from this project will positively impact the next generation multi-core and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures with improvements in energy efficiency, performance and robustness to hard faults and soft errors.

To improve<br/>performance under a limited energy budget, systems are becoming increasingly<br/>parallel, featuring many smaller and simpler cores, and heterogeneous,<br/>featuring cores specialized for certain tasks. Even with these improvements,<br/>two critical challenges remain. First, without reducing data movement, memory<br/>accesses and communication will dominate energy consumption. Thus, limiting<br/>data movement must become a primary design objective. Second, these systems<br/>will be highly complex, and will need powerful abstractions to shield<br/>programmers from this complexity. Current systems are designed in a<br/>computation-centric way that is a poor match for these challenges.

Technology scaling down to the sub-nanometer regime has aided the growth in transistors per chip that has made multi-core architectures a power-efficient approach to harnessing parallelism and improving performance. The computing capabilities of these multi-core architectures can be unleashed only if the underlying Network-on-Chip (NoC) connecting the cores can provide the required bandwidth within the power budget of the chip. However, the design of power-efficient, low-latency and high-bandwidth NoCs using traditional metallic interconnects that can scale to 1000 cores and beyond, is proving to be a significant challenge of enormous proportions. Research has shown that emerging technologies such as photonics and wireless have the potential to alleviate the critical bandwidth, power, and latency challenges of future NoCs. However, hybrid NoC designs taking advantages of both photonics and wireless technologies have not been explored.<br/><br/>This research proposes to lay the groundwork for completely re-thinking the NoC design and proposes to explore heterogeneity of emerging interconnect technology for designing performance scalable, and power-efficient NoCs. The overall objective is to combine multiple technologies to achieve our challenging goals of (1) scalability to 1000 cores, (2) power efficiency of at least a 50% power reduction as compared to the state-of-the-art metallic interconnects, and (3) high bandwidth and low latency across a wide variety of applications. First, at the architecture level, optics will be deployed for short-range (< 100 cores) to improve local communication and wireless for long-range communication in order to scale the number of cores to 1000 by providing sufficient global bandwidth. Second, at the circuit level, hybrid transceiver architectures will be explored to integrate novel ultra-low power wireless circuits based on SiGe/BiCMOS technology with optical waveguides and ring-resonators to provide the large bandwidth desired for kilo-core designs. Furthermore, wireless communication requirements will be addressed by designing mm-wave/THz frequency broadband and directional antennas based on advanced 3D printing technology. This proposal describes a transformative and viable approach combining technology, architecture, algorithms and applications research for designing scalable and energy-efficient NoCs. The cross-cutting nature of this research will foster new research directions in several areas, spanning technology/energy-aware NoC design, novel computer architectures, and cutting-edge modeling and simulations tools for emerging technologies."},{"AwardNumber":"1636488","Title":"Kahler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds","NSFOrganization":"DMS","Program(s)":"GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS","StartDate":"09/07/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"03/09/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Chi Li","State":"IN","Organization":"Purdue University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Shuguang Wang","EndDate":"06/30/2017","AwardedAmountToDate":"$104,311.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"li2285@purdue.edu","OrganizationStreet":"Young Hall","OrganizationCity":"West Lafayette","OrganizationState":"IN","OrganizationZip":"479072114","OrganizationPhone":"7654941055","NSFDirectorate":"MPS","ProgramElementCode(s)":"1265","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Einstein manifolds are geometric objects important in both mathematics and physics. In physics, they are used to describe the space-time in Einstein's theory of general relativity. In mathematics, they are basic building blocks of more complicated geometries. The study of Einstein manifolds is thus a basic problem in geometry. One effective way to construct Einstein manifolds is to require that the underlying manifold has a complex algebraic structure. In other words, the points of such a manifold are complex-valued solutions of polynomial equations. Einstein metrics on such algebraic manifolds are called Kaehler-Einstein metrics. In the late 70s, Aubin and Yau constructed Kaehler-Einstein metrics with negative Ricci curvatures. Yau also constructed Kaehler-Einstein metrics with zero Ricci curvatures, which are now called Calabi-Yau metrics and play important roles in the string theory of physics. On the other hand, only recently has people pinned down a sufficient and necessary condition, called K-stability, for the existence of Kaehler-Einstein metrics with positive Ricci curvatures for a class of algebraic manifolds called Fano manifolds. This result depends on the work of many people, most importantly by Tian and Donaldson. After these discoveries, we want to further our understandings of such Kaehler-Einstein metrics and the obstructions to their existence. These problems are the main concerns of the proposal. The study of these Kaehler-Einstein metrics will greatly improve our understanding of Einstein manifolds important in both physics and mathematics. <br/><br/>In this proposal, the PI will study the following closely related problems. 1.Various continuity methods of partial differential equations are used to solve the Kaehler-Einstein equation. The recent breakthroughs give qualitative pictures of blow up behaviors and convergences of these continuity methods. However, deeper quantitative understandings of the blow up behaviors or singularity forming phenomena are needed. The PI has studied in detail such quantitative properties for toric Fano manifolds. The PI will study the singularities forming processes for a broader class of Fano manifolds. The PI will also study the classification of the singularities formed in low dimensions by combining the methods from Riemannian geometry and algebraic geometry. 2.The PI will study concrete constructions of Kaehler-Einstein metrics and related canonical metrics. On the one hand, the PI likes to extend the construction of toric Kaehler-Einstein metrics to other Kaehler-Einstein metrics with large symmetries, for example, on spherical varieties. On the other hand, the PI will study the classification of Sasaki-Einstein metrics with large symmetries in low dimensions based on his calculations of important examples. Related methods will also be applied to construct Kaehler-Ricci solitons and extremal Kaehler metrics. 3.The PI will study the deformations of canonical Kaehler metrics including Kaehler-Einstein metrics and Kaehler-Ricci solitons, and to understand the moduli spaces of these canonical Kaehler metrics. He will also study the singularities on the boundaries of these moduli spaces. 4.The PI and his collaborator will study the K-stability using algebraic geometry based on their previous work on K-stability. They will use tools from minimal model program to test K-stability.

To provide dynamic spectrum access, auction based spectrum trading has received considerable attention. In spectrum trading, licensed users rent their unused spectrum to unlicensed users in exchange for money. The availability of unused spectrum depends on the usage pattern of licensed users and varies over time, frequency, and spatial domain. Unlicensed users can bid for this spectrum according to their needs which again vary by time and location. Thus, the auction scenario has to deal with the dynamic user demand and dynamic spectrum supply. Existing research on spectrum trading consider either a static auction environment or at most one side of the dynamics of the auction environment. Therefore, for improving spectrum unitization, it is critical to consider an auction scenario where bidders with heterogeneous demand arrive dynamically and bid for dynamically available spectrum units.<br/><br/>This project studies a dynamic auction framework and undertakes the development of auction rules and regulations designed to achieve an efficient spectrum allocation. The study consists of four major components. (1) Developing the dynamic auction framework with dynamic arrival of users with variable lifetime and dynamic spectrum supply. (2) Tackling the design challenges associated with the diversity in demand and supply in terms of units and duration and devising a truthful auction mechanism. (3) Designing a generic auction framework to fit the auction rules and regulations and define the communication method using a secure communication protocol. (4) Developing a testbed to implement, experiment and validate the auction framework. This research will enhance radio spectrum sharing and utilization, providing more spectrum opportunities for existing and new applications. This project provides interdisciplinary research opportunities for graduate students working on the proposed research. This project incorporates research results into courses and to recruit students from underrepresented backgrounds."},{"AwardNumber":"1619816","Title":"CAREER: Combating Dark Silicon through Specialization: Communication-Aware Tiled Many-Accelerator Architectures","NSFOrganization":"CCF","Program(s)":"SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FOUNDATION","StartDate":"10/01/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"05/23/2016","PrincipalInvestigator":"Mark Hempstead","State":"MA","Organization":"Tufts University","AwardInstrument":"Continuing grant","ProgramManager":"Tao Li","EndDate":"01/31/2019","AwardedAmountToDate":"$125,080.00","Co-PIName(s)":"","PIEmailAddress":"mark@ece.tufts.edu","OrganizationStreet":"20 Professors Row","OrganizationCity":"Medford","OrganizationState":"MA","OrganizationZip":"021555807","OrganizationPhone":"6176273417","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"7798","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"1045, 7941","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Researchers have predicted that, in the coming years, the computer industry?s steady gains in computing performance will slow and even cease all together because of a condition known as Dark Silicon. Dark Silicon is the result of an increase in power density that will make it necessary to leave sections of a microchip powered off. The consequences of Dark Silicon could be widespread, limiting the increasing benefits all aspects of society---from medicine, commerce to entertainment----have reaped from advances in computing. One solution is specialization. With the advent of high-level synthesis tools capable of generating circuits from high-level programming languages such as C, it is now possible to realize specialized accelerators for any application with 10-100x the efficiency of general purpose microprocessors. The computing industry needs new architecture paradigms to organize thousands of these accelerators. This project envisions the computing platform of the future as comprised of domain specific tiles, each with 10-100 specialized accelerators. The research team will advance this vision with innovations in two aspects. First, by inventing a new memory-interconnect subsystem capable of keeping these specialized cores fed with data. Second, canonical tiles will be invented for different application domains that can be studied by the wider research community.<br/><br/>The team will study memory-interconnect systems for tiles in a manner that recognizes the unique features of many-accelerator architectures: intermittent usage of accelerators, bursts of communication, and the need to share memory between specialized cores. While designing tiles of many-accelerators, the team will develop a new description language that describes the computation and communication capabilities of a tile and matches them with a graph representation of the workload. To provide broader impact, the tools, canonical designs, and models developed by this project will be made available to the wider research community to enable the study and eventual commercialization of specialized architectures. As increasing the technological literacy of the general public is essential to cultivating responsible behavior, the integrated educational plan focuses on all age groups: it reaches K-12 students through workshops and presentations; undergraduate and graduate students through research opportunities and course offerings; and the greater Philadelphia community."},{"AwardNumber":"1531382","Title":"MRI: Acquisition of a Multi-Beam SEM/FIB for Multidisciplinary Materials Study and Training","NSFOrganization":"CMMI","Program(s)":"MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION","StartDate":"10/01/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"09/03/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Lin Li","State":"MS","Organization":"Jackson State University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Joanne D.

The Communication network, which conveys system measurements from sensors to controllers, plays a key role in CPSs, similarly to the nerve system in human beings. Traditional data communication networks (e.g., cellular networks or WiFi) focus only the delivery of data packets, while the ultimate goal of a CPS is to control the physical dynamics (e.g., stabilizing the voltages and frequencies in power networks). Hence, the traditional design of communication network may not be optimal in the context of CPSs, due to the mismatched goals of designs. This results in a pressing need to study the design of communication networks in CPSs, which helps to enhance the agility, robustness and efficiency of CPSs. This project studies how to efficiently design system-dynamics-aware communication networks for CPS, which integrates the areas of communications, networking, control, and dynamical systems, and has applications to the important and growing field of CPS in critical infrastructures.<br/><br/>The project specifically addresses the following research tasks: (a) Joint Design as Hybrid Systems: The theory of hybrid systems is used to model CPS, in which the operation mode of communication network is modeled as the discrete state of a hybrid system, while the physical dynamics are modeled using the continuous state. The communication and control sub-systems are designed jointly by optimizing the hybrid system dynamics; (b) Separate Design via Information Interface: The communication and control sub-systems are designed separately and are bridged via designated interfaces, such as communication quality of service (QoS) or virtual queue mapping; (c) Coexistence with Elastic Data Traffics: The realtime data traffic may share the same communication resource with elastic data traffics such as Internet data. The queuing dynamics of elastic data traffic and the physical dynamics of CPS are integrated in the same framework, and the scheduling for the two types of traffics (elastic and realtime) is studied; (d) Application and Implementation in Smart Grid: The principles, algorithms, and protocols obtained in the previous two tasks are applied and substantiated in smart grids as a case study for CPS. The voltage control in microgrid, both centralized and decentralized, is particularly studied. They are implemented in both software simulation testbed, in which the communication and control sub-systems are co-simulated, and hardware testbed using USRP boards and the microgrid testbed."},{"AwardNumber":"1524462","Title":"CSR: Small: Towards Energy-efficient Internet Mobile Streaming","NSFOrganization":"CNS","Program(s)":"COMPUTER SYSTEMS","StartDate":"10/01/2015","LastAmendmentDate":"08/25/2015","PrincipalInvestigator":"Songqing Chen","State":"VA","Organization":"George Mason University","AwardInstrument":"Standard Grant","ProgramManager":"Amy Apon","EndDate":"09/30/2018","AwardedAmountToDate":"$495,426.00","Co-PIName(s)":"Fei Li","PIEmailAddress":"sqchen@cs.gmu.edu","OrganizationStreet":"4400 UNIVERSITY DR","OrganizationCity":"FAIRFAX","OrganizationState":"VA","OrganizationZip":"220304422","OrganizationPhone":"7039932295","NSFDirectorate":"CSE","ProgramElementCode(s)":"7354","ProgramReferenceCode(s)":"7923","ARRAAmount":"$0.00","Abstract":"Today more people are enjoying streaming services on their mobile devices from anywhere at anytime.

It proposes to build battery-free sensing network (BFSN) by exploiting the ambient energy to support its operation. By removing the need for battery, it will support a sustainable operation, especially in hazard conditions. The underlying novelty is the establishment of a hybrid architecture (composed of three layers: battery-free devices, battery-powered devices, and base-stations) to enable the battery-free multi-hop networking with the low-power supply, extremely limited computation and storage in battery-free devices. The proposed research has the potential to revolutionize the communication architecture for sensor and cyber-physical systems, lowering their cost and easing their management.<br/><br/>Many key challenges in realizing the benefits of BFSN will focus on the small-sized battery-free devices, such as charging these devices, placement of devices and charging stations, networking these devices and the wider network, and locating them.

A CR-capable service provider can acquire spectrum on demand from the secondary spectrum market to avoid paying the huge spectrum licensing fees, significantly lowering the threshold of entry to the wireless business. As a result, it is foreseeable that small and local secondary wireless service providers (SSPs) will flourish, transforming the wireless business from one dictated by few giant carriers to a much more competitive marketplace. Existing secondary spectrum market models mainly consider a market comprised by big SSPs, where every SSP is assumed to have sufficient secondary radio resource and coverage to independently service end users. In practice, however, these models inevitably exclude the large number of small and local SSPs that do not have enough resource and coverage to independently satisfy the demand of end users (e.g., for high-rate access or long-range routing) from the market, leading to reduced market competitiveness, and henceforth compromised market efficiency. This project will investigate a novel competition-and-collaboration spectrum market framework, whereby small and local SSPs will collaborate in providing service to retain more market shares, better profitability, stronger market competitiveness, and higher market efficiency. This project, if successful, will significantly advance our understanding on the network economics of the secondary spectrum ecosystem comprised by primary spectrum sellers, SSPs, end users, and human, and will contribute to the real-world deployment of economically feasible and sustainable spectrum market.<br/><br/>The proposed research will follow three thrusts. (1) For short-term services, assuming perfect rationality for every player in the market, the secondary spectrum market is first modeled as a spot market. A truthful procurement auction model is proposed to study the optimal market mechanisms and their strategy proofness under a variety of market conditions. (2) For long-term services, the project will study the potential and implication of the futures market, in which service predictability in the time domain is exploited to improve market efficiency, using methods such as option pricing and hedging. (3) The rational-player assumption is released and the project will study the impact of irrationality and human factors on market efficiency using methods from Behavioral Economics. This project will also carry out a comprehensive educational plan to broaden its impact, including integrating research with undergraduate and graduate education, recruiting and outreaching to minority and under-represented students, and efficient dissemination and outreaching to the general public."}]}]
